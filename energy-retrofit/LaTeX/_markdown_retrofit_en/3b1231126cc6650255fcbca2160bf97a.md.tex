\markdownRendererHeadingOne{Design Architecture — Dual Buffers}\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator
{}This document defines the hydraulic concept, operating modes, key setpoints, and component sizing for the dual‑buffer plan: a dedicated always‑hot DHW heating buffer feeding a FriWa, plus a separate heating/cooling buffer that is hot in winter and cold in summer. No air conditioners or fan‑coils are used; cooling is via UFH with dew‑point protection.\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator
