# Operating Guide — Daily Use and Seasonal Tips

This guide summarizes how to operate the system day‑to‑day and what to expect seasonally.

## Everyday

- DHW is on demand via FriWa; expect stable temperature at taps. Large simultaneous draws may cause a brief temperature dip; the DHW buffer will recover quickly.
- The system prefers midday DHW charging using PV. If weather is poor, DHW will still be maintained.
- Home Assistant shows buffer temps, humidity, and basic status; use notifications for filter service and unusual conditions.

## Winter (Heating)

- Weather‑compensated heating curve aims for low VL (~28–35°C). Radiant comfort is gradual but steady.
- Wood stove usage: enjoy as desired; it will lift buffer top temperature and the heat pump will trim back accordingly.
- If rooms feel cool, increase room setpoint slightly or raise the heating curve minimally; avoid large jumps.

## Summer (Cooling)

- Night charging chills the buffer to ~16–18°C. Daytime UFH supply is limited by dew‑point logic (typically 19–21°C); expect gentle background cooling.
- If indoor RH rises toward 60% and cooling pauses, ventilate during dry periods or use a temporary dehumidifier. This system intentionally avoids AC.

## Shoulder Seasons

- Minimal buffer temps; most comfort from passive gains and small heating boosts. DHW still prioritized around midday.

## Maintenance

- Filters: HRV and FriWa potable filter — inspect every 3–6 months (adjust to dust/water conditions).
- Visual checks: inspect for any condensation on cold manifolds/lines in early summer; increase dew‑point margin if needed.
- Annual service: verify safety valves, expansion vessel pressures, water quality (VDI 2035), heat meter readings.

## Troubleshooting Hints

- Hot water too cool: check DHW buffer temperature, FriWa outlet setting, and potable filter cleanliness.
- Cooling feels weak: check dew‑point limit vs. supply temp; if RH high, dry the air (ventilate when dry or dehumidify temporarily).
- Noise: enable night modes (HP and HRV), verify mounts and baffles.
