# Energy Retrofit Documentation

This folder contains a complete, implementation‑ready set of documents for the dual‑buffer energy retrofit concept of a 1972 mid‑terrace house. It consolidates design targets (Effizienzhaus 85 + Erneuerbare‑Energien‑Klasse), hydraulic architecture, envelope measures, decentralized HRV plan, controls, funding, commissioning, and risks.

Use this index to navigate:

- 01_project-overview.md — Context, goals, targets, baseline
- 02_design-architecture.md — Dual‑buffer hydraulic design and operating modes
- 03_dhw.md — DHW via FriWa with dedicated DHW heating buffer
- 04_ventilation-hrv.md — Decentralized single‑room HRV plan (DIN 1946‑6)
- 05_envelope-airtightness.md — Insulation, airtightness, loggia/entry options
- 06_controls-sensors-monitoring.md — Safety controls, dew‑point logic, HA orchestration
- 07_funding-compliance.md — KfW/BAFA/iSFP, cost separation, notes
- 08_commissioning-acceptance.md — Checklists, tests, documentation
- 09_phases-plan.md — Project phases and recommended order
- 10_bill-of-materials.md — Parts/spec classes and sizing guidance
- 11_risks-mitigations.md — Key risks and mitigations
- 12_open-decisions.md — Pending decisions and options

All documents are written to be brand‑agnostic, focused on specifications and procedures required to plan, build, and commission the system.
