# Funding, Compliance, Documentation

This section outlines a funding approach aligned with current concepts. Always verify current program rules and eligibility with an Energie‑Effizienz‑Experte (EEE) and your bank before committing.

## Primary Route — KfW 261 (Wohngebäude – Kredit)

- Goal: Effizienzhaus 85 + Erneuerbare‑Energien‑Klasse (≥65% renewable share for heat/cold).
- Credit scope: heat pump system, buffers, FriWa, hydraulic periphery, safety, system electricals; potentially wood stove with back‑boiler as part of the system scope.
- Repayment bonus: typically 10% on the financed portion once confirmed by EEE after completion.
- Important: Costs financed within the EH loan pot cannot be double‑funded elsewhere.

## Complementary — Einzelmaßnahmen (BAFA/BEG)

- Apply to building envelope (basement/roof/windows/facade), decentralized HRV, measurement/control/automation (MSR), and UFH distribution.
- Typical rates: 15% or 20% with iSFP (individueller Sanierungsfahrplan).
- Rule: No double‑funding of the same cost position if already in KfW 261 EH pot.

## Additional Financing

- Supplementary loans (e.g., KfW programs 358/359) for Einzelmaßnahmen up to common caps per dwelling.
- PV and battery: 0% VAT on supply/install; can be financed separately (e.g., KfW 270) or via bank.

## Process and Timing

- Engage an EEE early. Obtain “Bestätigung zum Antrag” (BzA) before awarding contracts, or use suspensive clauses.
- Clean cost separation: define which positions are under EH‑loan vs. Einzelmaßnahmen to avoid double‑funding.
- Post‑completion “Bestätigung nach Durchführung” (BnD) to trigger repayment bonus and finalize grants.

## Documentation and Compliance

- Design calculations: EN 12831 heat load; ventilation concept per DIN 1946‑6; dew‑point logic; thermal bridge details.
- Commissioning protocols: blower‑door (pre/post), hydraulic balancing, water quality (VDI 2035), pressure tests, heat meter setup, HP commissioning.
- Safety: stove per EN 303‑5 with return lift, thermal discharge, emergency cooling; electrical SPDs and backup subpanel documentation.
- Monitoring: first‑season data logs (temperatures, humidity, heat/power meters) to validate performance.

## Notes

- Funding programs evolve. Validate all rates, caps, and eligibility windows at application time.
- Maintain a single source of truth for cost allocation and supporting documents to simplify audits.
