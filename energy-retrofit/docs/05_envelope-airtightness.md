# Envelope, Airtightness, Thermal Bridges

This section defines measures for insulation, airtightness, and mitigation of key thermal bridges (loggia, open entrance/vestibule, open staircase to cellar).

## Targets (EH85‑aligned)

- Basement ceiling U ≤ 0.25 W/(m²·K)
- Roof/attic U ≤ 0.14 W/(m²·K)
- Windows Uw ≤ 0.90 W/(m²·K) with warm edge spacers
- Airtightness n50 ≤ 1.5 h⁻¹ (blower‑door before/after)

## Measures

- Basement ceiling insulation (must): rigid boards or blown‑in solutions; ensure continuous coverage around beams and services; seal penetrations.
- Roof/attic insulation (must): on‑roof insulation or upper ceiling; maintain continuous airtight layer; detail penetrations and edges.
- Windows (must): triple glazing, airtight installation with tapes and compressible seals; verify reveal insulation.
- Facade (optional, recommended): external WDVS where feasible; if not, capillary‑active internal insulation (e.g., CaSi/wood fibre) at critical interior surfaces; model details to avoid vapor traps.
- Airtightness package (must): professional sealing, tape schedules, and blower‑door test pre/post.

## Staircase to Cellar (Open Stair)

- Install airtight glazed partition/door at basement or ground‑floor landing; maintain natural light; perimeter seals.
- Combine with basement ceiling insulation to cut stack‑effect losses.

## Loggia (Interior Balcony) Options

- Winter garden conversion: high‑performance triple glazing, thermally broken frames, insulated parapets/soffits, exterior shading; best comfort and thermal‑bridge fix; requires structural and permit checks.
- Targeted thermal‑bridge remediation: capillary‑active internal insulation at junctions; add exterior insulation if feasible; less impact but lower cost.

## Open Entrance / Covered Entry (Below Living Space)

- Glazed vestibule (Windfang): insulated framing and external door; major infiltration/comfort improvement; may require permit.
- Underside insulation: rigid PIR/EPS below ceiling; seal side‑wall junctions; economical but smaller impact.

## Verification

- Thermography after completion to identify residual thermal bridges.
- Blower‑door test (n50 ≤ 1.5 h⁻¹) with documented leakage sealing actions.
