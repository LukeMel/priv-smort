# Risks and Mitigations

Key technical and project risks with practical mitigations.

## Hydronic Cooling and Condensation

- Risk: UFH surface and manifolds falling below dew point → condensation, damage.
- Mitigations: hard dew‑point limit controlling mixing valve; diffusion‑tight insulation on cold lines; condensate routing; humidity monitoring per floor; disable cooling if RH persistently > 60%.

## System Complexity

- Risk: Dual buffers + FriWa + stove add components and controls.
- Mitigations: safety interlocks in dedicated controllers (not HA); clear operating modes; thorough commissioning; labeled valves/wiring; service documentation.

## Noise (Terrace Context)

- Risk: Outdoor unit and HRV noise disturbing occupants/neighbors.
- Mitigations: acoustic siting and shielding; resilient mounts; night mode; façade‑friendly HRV placements with baffles.

## Thermal Bridges (Loggia, Entry)

- Risk: Heat loss, cold surfaces, moisture.
- Mitigations: Prefer enclosure (winter garden/vestibule); otherwise capillary‑active internal insulation and exterior shading; thermography post‑works.

## Water Quality and Scaling

- Risk: Scaling and corrosion in plate HX, pumps, valves.
- Mitigations: VDI 2035 treatment; potable‑side filters; periodic checks; bypass/flush ports for service.

## Funding/Timing Errors

- Risk: Double‑funding, out‑of‑sequence contracting jeopardizing eligibility.
- Mitigations: EEE involvement; BzA before award; clean cost split; BnD after completion; maintain documentation.

## Safety (Stove Integration)

- Risk: Overheating without heat dump; low return temp tar formation; insufficient expansion.
- Mitigations: return‑lift valve (≥60°C), thermal discharge valve to drain, gravity emergency cooling path, expansion vessel sizing; certified components and installation.
