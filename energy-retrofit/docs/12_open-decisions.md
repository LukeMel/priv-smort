# Open Decisions and Options

Use this page to track pending choices and finalize with the installer/EEE.

## DHW and Buffers

- Confirm DHW heating buffer volume: 200 L vs. 300 L based on peak draw habits.
- FriWa capacity class: 25 kW vs. 35 kW based on simultaneous draw expectations.
- Optional cross‑charge: allow emergency heat transfer from heating/cooling buffer top to DHW buffer (complexity vs. resilience).

## Separation and Fluids

- Optional AWHP↔House plate heat exchanger (glycol on AWHP side):
  - Pros: freeze protection and oxygen ingress isolation.
  - Cons: small efficiency penalty; added components.

## Loggia and Entryway

- Loggia: winter garden enclosure (permit, cost, highest benefit) vs. targeted internal insulation + exterior shading (budget option).
- Entry: glazed vestibule (high impact) vs. underside insulation only (lower impact).

## HRV Units

- Device type: dual‑fan continuous vs. push‑pull pairs; acoustic priorities.
- Controls: standalone vs. optional gateway into HA for monitoring.

## Heat Pump Selection

- Capacity class: based on EN 12831 result and modulation range.
- Acoustic package and siting: night mode, shielding, neighbor impact.

## Monitoring and Data

- Heat meters scope: AWHP only vs. AWHP + FriWa primary.
- Data retention: first season mandatory; optional long‑term trends.
