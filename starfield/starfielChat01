Is there a starfield mod that gives me a fully built outpost? With resorce management and so on?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 3s
Short answer: yes—via prefabs—and you can bolt on QoL mods for “resource management.” There isn’t (yet) a one-click “spawn a galaxy-wide, fully automated supply chain,” but these get very close:

Prefab, fully built bases (drop-in outposts)

Outpost NPC Prefab – Fortified Encampment (Bethesda Creations / Nexus): place a complete fortified base from the outpost menu; requires Outpost skills; costs credits; generates ~200 power. Great as a ready-made hub, then you add extractors/links as needed. 
creations.bethesda.net
+1

Outpost NPC Prefab – Deserted Relay Station (Creations / Nexus): another prebuilt complex (lights, doors, airlocks, containers). Listed cost ~2,000,000 credits; produces ~150 power. 
creations.bethesda.net
+1

Note: users report placement quirks on uneven terrain (you may want a “build anywhere” helper). 
Nexus Mods

Resource-management & logistics QoL (pair with a prefab)

Outpost Resource Collector (The ORC): access and gather resources from anywhere in your outpost or ship hold—cuts a ton of crate-shuffling. 
Nexus Mods

High/ Increased Cargo Link Capacity: boosts the amount each cargo ship moves per trip; reduces bottlenecks. 
Nexus Mods
+1

TN’s Outpost Storage (multiplier): 3×–50× storage for containers so lines don’t jam. 
Nexus Mods

Supply Mission Fix: repairs stuck delivery missions if you use the in-game supply jobs to move goods. 
Nexus Mods

“Build/expand better” toolkits (if you want more than vanilla pieces)

Modular Outposts: Argos Extractors (Creations): furnished/unfurnished habs, structural pieces, pads, utilities. Not a whole base in one click, but lets you assemble one fast. 
creations.bethesda.net

OUT – Outpost Ultimate Tweaks: huge outpost expansion (items, research, snapping, etc.). 
Nexus Mods

Outpost Anywhere: relaxes placement limits, useful when a prefab refuses to snap on slopes. 
Nexus Mods

Bottom line:
If you want a ready-made base today, install one of the Outpost NPC Prefabs and then add extractors + cargo links. Layer ORC (global resource access) and cargo/storage tweaks to make the “resource management” essentially painless. That’s the closest current setup to a “fully built, self-running” outpost.

Want me to propose a minimal, stable load order (prefab + 2–3 QoL mods) and where each shows up in the build menu?

You said:
anything more premade??
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 25s
Yep—if you want “drop-in and done,” these are the most premade options right now:

Outpost NPC Prefab – Deserted Relay Station (PC/Xbox, Creations + Nexus). Places a complete relay-station complex (doors, lights, containers) as one object; requires Outpost skills; author lists ~2,000,000 cr cost and ~150 power output. You’ll still add a landing pad/cargo links yourself. 
creations.bethesda.net
+1

Outpost NPC Prefab – Fortified Encampment (PC/Xbox, Creations + Nexus). Full fortified base you place from the build menu; acts as an instant hub. Users note terrain/navmesh quirks on uneven ground—pair with a “build anywhere” helper if needed. 
creations.bethesda.net
+2
Nexus Mods
+2

Tower Hab 2 (Betamax76) (PC/Xbox). Adds six pre-built, navmeshed towers (cluttered and empty variants) you drop in like a single piece; includes lighting switches, fences, snap nodes. Recent updates fixed crew pathing. 
Nexus Mods

Betamax’s Outpost Framework (PC). Expansion set with pre-furnished habs and snap-together pieces; designed to work with Tower Hab/other Betamax items for very fast “assemble-a-base” builds. 
Nexus Mods

“Build Outposts in Restricted Zones (Over POI)” (PC). Not a prefab, but the most turnkey approach: lets you claim existing NPC POIs (labs, towers, outposts) as your build area—effectively moving into a fully built complex, then you just add pad/links. 
Nexus Mods

Make it “almost fully automatic”
After dropping one prefab (or taking over a POI), add:

High-Capacity Cargo Links (doubles freighter throughput) + TN’s Outpost Storage (3×–50× container capacity) to avoid jams, and Outpost Resource Collector (ORC) to pull resources from anywhere in the outpost. 
Nexus Mods

If you want, I can give you a minimal, stable load order (PC/Xbox split) and the exact build-menu locations for each piece so you can place a working outpost in 2–3 minutes.

You said:
Wicked Workshop? maybe
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 20s
Short answer: Yes—Wicked Workshop is the closest “premade outpost” suite right now. It doesn’t spawn a one-click extractor farm, but it gives you drop-in camps, crewed hubs, vendors/guards, cargo-link pads, shipbuilders, power, and mission boards so you can place a functional base in minutes.

What to install (minimal “premade” stack)
Wicked Workshop – Outpost Projeckt 2 (base pack; adds 37 pre-built hab types, garages, custom storage, cargo-link landing pads, and two special crew-station structures designed for quick mining hubs with mission/bounty boards). 
Nexus Mods

Wicked Workshop – Fortified (expansion; adds Science/Industrial/Military Camps, walled forts, stackable generators/reactors, shipbuilders, cargo-link variants—great as drop-in compounds). 
Nexus Mods

Wicked Workshop – Fielded (expansion; adds buildable NPC vendors, guards, robots, crewstations, mission/navigation/bounty terminals, cargo-link desks, and large field generators—turns your outpost into a living settlement). 
Nexus Mods

Platforms: All three are on Nexus (PC); many entries are also on Bethesda Creations (PC/Xbox). 
creations.bethesda.net

Nexus Mods

Nexus Mods

How “premade” it gets in practice
Outpost Projeckt 2 includes “Special Structures” (Science Bay / Field Hab) that count as Crew Stations, include workbenches + mission/bounty boards, and are explicitly meant for a “quick and easy mining outpost.” Drop one, add a pad + links, and you’re operational. 
Nexus Mods

Fortified adds Science/Industrial/Military Camps and Walled Forts you place as single objects—effectively prefab compounds. 
Nexus Mods

Fielded lets you place functional vendors, security teams, robots and guards, plus mission/navigation/bounty terminals and cargo-link desks, so the base behaves like a staffed settlement. 
Nexus Mods

Quick recipe (2–3 minutes)
Place a Large Landing Pad HQ (from Outpost Projeckt 2) or a Camp/Walled Fort (from Fortified). 
Nexus Mods
+1

Add a Cargo-Link pad/desk and a Field Generator (Fielded). 
Nexus Mods

Drop a Crewstation and a Vendor (Fielded) for staffing and trading. 
Nexus Mods

(Optional) Snap in extractors + links as needed (still manual—no mod fully auto-places resource chains).

Resource-management QoL (optional)
High-Capacity Cargo Links – doubles freighter throughput to prevent bottlenecks. 
Nexus Mods

Outpost Resource Collector (The ORC) – pull any resource from anywhere in your outpost/ship hold via a workbench menu. 
Nexus Mods
+1

Notes & caveats
Dependencies: All expansions require Outpost Projeckt 2; Shattered (optional theme pack) requires the Shattered Space DLC. 
Nexus Mods
+1

Stability: The author advises a quicksave + immediate reload after building large structures so everything “bakes in.” 
Nexus Mods

Menu locations: Objects are injected near the bottom of the Structures tab; you’ll also find items under Crewstations, Field Tech, Cargo Links, Workbenches (Fielded lists). 
Nexus Mods
+1

If you want, I’ll give you a tight load order (PC vs. Xbox/Creations) and the exact build-menu paths for the pieces above so you can place a working, staffed outpost fast.

You said:
is there a good mod that increases outpost storage?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 11s
Yes—several solid options:

#1 TN’s Outpost Storage (storage multiplier) — PC (Nexus) & PC/Xbox (Creations). Lets you pick a multiplier (x3…x50) for all vanilla outpost storage types (solid/gas/liquid/warehouse) and also ups cargo-link in/out and the transfer container (e.g., 5,000 at x10). ESL-flagged; updated 2024-11-05. 
Nexus Mods

Expanded Outpost Containers (Arthmoor) — Creations (all platforms, incl. Xbox). Simple, stable 10× capacity for all outpost storage containers. Great if you want a “just works” console-friendly option. 
creations.bethesda.net
+1

Infinite Storage Boxes — PC (Nexus) & PC/Xbox (Creations). Adds 16 buildable containers with infinite capacity for ships/outposts/apartments. Note: these are “decoration” containers; handy for hoarding, but they don’t integrate with crafting benches/outpost networks.

Tip (throughput)
If you’re scaling production, pair storage mods with High-Capacity Cargo Links to double freighter throughput so lines don’t jam.

If you tell me PC vs Xbox and how aggressive you want the multiplier, I’ll suggest a minimal, stable pick (e.g., TN’s x10 + high-cap cargo links).

You said:
I'll go with this 
SKK Universal Stash (unlimited storage)
Connect all workbenches and outposts to a shared unlimited storage container for building and crafting. ALL YOUR STUFF IN ONE PLACE,  access from anywhere using menus, favorites or hotkeys.


The Starfield version of Fallout 4 GLOBAL STASH and Fallout 76 Stash﻿



Install this at any stage in any game, the player automatically gets a regenerating [ Universal Stash menu item ] in AID inventory when the mod starts up. As new game start clears player inventory, craft replacements at any Industral workbench with 1 [ Fe ] iron.  Universal Stash needs to be enabled in the Lodge to start working.


================
Configuration Menu


(1) Enable Universal stash (bedroom) Configures the Lodge player bedroom safe [ 00266e81 ] to be persistent so it can be accessed from anywhere in the universe. It is a base game placed unlimited container that never resets so is totally safe (geddit ?) to store all your stuff.

This must be run in the Lodge so there is an option to automatically teleport the player there, enable the stash and return back to the starting point. 

Each Workbench is automatically connected to the stash for crafting materials on first activation. Yes thats any workbench anywhere including Outposts and your homeships as they change. Homeship workbenches also use crafting materials in the cargo hold. Outpost workbenches also use crafting materials from Outpost storage.

(2) Enable Universal stash (basement) same as (1) but moves the safe to the Lodge basement for easier access. 

(3) Disable Universal stash must be run in the Lodge. Resets the safe to its original bedroom location, removes the persistence links and stops new workbench connections. You can switch between enable/disable as much as you like, your stuff is always safe (!) in the no reset base game placed container.

(4) Open Universal stash from anywhere in the universe, or craft a [ Universal Stash open container item ] to favourite for single key access,  or use a hotkey console command (see below). If you choose use toxic lockpicking mods that break base game methods this will not work.

(5) Open Homeship cargo hold  from anywhere in the universe. The ability to transfer items sometimes depends on console [ SetGS fMaxShipTransferDistance value ] which defaults to 250 meters.

(6) Switch Inventory between Homeship and Stash from anywhere in the universe. If HomeShip has any inventory everything is moved to the Stash, else if empty Stash inventory is moved to to HomeShip ignoring ship hold capacity and distance limits. If there are inventory items to ignore, add them to formlists SKK_USExcludeStashItems and SKK_USExcludeShipItems with xEdit (if you know how).  Ship Repair Kits are already excluded to always stay on ship.

(7) Move to Universal stash container in the Lodge from anywhere in the universe. Ths can cause the Homeship to be left at the last landing point and not reset to Atlantis spaceport. Workaround is to use Move to homeship then fly.

(8) Move to Homeship main cabin from anywhere in the universe.

(9) Reset Outpost transfer container clears the contents of the last connected Outpost transfer container back to the Lodge stash. Read the Outpost section to learn more.

(10) Automatic Outpost transfer [ *On | Off ] disable all automatic (Stash <> Outpost) transfer connections if you are having problems. Read the Outpost section to learn more. 

(11) Consolidate all production [ *Off | On ] with this enabled when you activate a production container it triggers all production containers to move their contents to the active outpost transfer container.


Menu items are actually potions which live in AID inventory and regenerate after each use, so each crafting recipe is only shown if there are none already in player inventory.


=============================
Outposts & Decorators (Home/Ship) 

Outpost Stash Transfer 

When Universal Stash is enabled one [ Universal Stash Outpost transfer ] container can be built at each Outpost/Decorator (Miscellanious menu) to provide building resources. Default is to automatically move all of the central Lodge stash container inventory to itself when the player is on site at the Outpost/Decorator for EZ access and return it to the central Lodge stash when the player leaves (Automatic Outpost transfer setting ON). Or you can transfer manually using the activation menu.

There is a warning if another transfer container is detected in the loaded area (up to 1200 meters) and automatic transfers are disabled until the check runs again at the next 3d load event. Use the [ Switch with Stash ] transfer container activation option to manually transfer inventory.

A stash outpost transfer container provides building material direct to the Outpost and crafting material to the Workbenches. Outpost building and Workbenches will also use material from any normal Outpost containers. 

When the player leaves the Outpost, all the outpost transfer container inventory is automatically transferred back to the central Lodge stash container for persistent safety (with Automatic Outpost transfer setting ON). If for any reason that doesnt work, use the [ Reset Outpost Transfer Container ] menu option or just go to the Lodge which always forces inventory back to the central Lodge stash.

Removing a Transfer container or the whole Outpost triggers the base game to dump any inventory on the Player before scripts can detect that condition. Use the [ Switch to Stash ] container activation option or [ Reset Outpost Transfer Container ] menu option FIRST to move all the stuff back to the central Lodge stash before removing a container or Outpost.


Outpost Resource Collection

To handle resource production build one [ Outpost Production Collector ] (Miscellanious menu) with 999,999 capacity to which any resource producer or cargo link can be connected, collecting all production in one place all of the time when on or offsite.

Activate [ to Stash ] or [ R ] to transfer all contents to a local stash outpost transfer container if present. The game engine will not automatically transfer Outpost produced resources to any unlimited storage container to avoid breaking your game with uncapped item counts.  In the spirit of protecting your game, this Production Collector transfer will not be automated and the best you get is the Consolidate all production option on the manual activation trigger.


********************************************************************************
WARNING: the blue Outpost ship transfer container may be causing problems.
Do not connect it to a Stash Transfer Container if you want to keep your stuff.

=================
Console and Hotkeys


If you don't want more immersive crap in your inventory and prefer to use console commands, BAT files or hotkey, no problem. Call a global proxy function WITHOUT the ;; semicolon description:

Spoiler:  Show

If you start new games from different locations and want to quickly enable Universal Stash this will hop the player to the Lodge, enable the  stash then hop back to starting position: 

CallGlobalFunction "SKK_USQuestScript.EnableFromAnywhere"



===========================
(a) Install version 007 (or earlier)

The original ESM versions created with xEdit and loose scripts which works with any Starfield version.  

Spoiler:  Show


=======================================
(b) Upgrade from 007 (or earler) to 008 (or later)

If you are updating an existing 007 or older installation to the Starfield June 2024 (or later) CreationKit ESM & BA2 edition, there are some housekeeping steps you (or your mod organiser) need to perform:

Spoiler:  Show  


=========================
(c) Install version 008 or later 

CreationKit ESM & BA2 edition requires Starfield June 2024 (or later) update.

Install this mod at any time in any game. It is 100% new content, makes no changes to any existing content and has ZERO dependencies. As it does not touch any other stuff in your save-game, it has no load order needs. 

Copy SKKUniversalStash.esm and SKKUniversalStash – Main.BA2 to your ...\Starfield\Data directory and add to Plugins.txt, or use a mod manger or however you organise. Even though some may get lucky, SKK does not support the removal of any CreationEngine mod from an active savegame. Those who know, know. 



===================================
Validate your installation in a running game

In a running game copy and paste the text [ between the square brackets ] into the console:

To validate scripts console [ cgf "SKK_USQuestScript.GetVersion" 1 ]
To validate the ESM console [ help SKK_USQuest 4 quest ]



==================
Quality & Compatibility


(1) This is 100% new forms and scripts. As it does not modify any base game content at all, the likelyhood of it CAUSING conflict is zero. If you have issues, just start with your stuff that does hack the base game.

(2) Some mods that hack the UI or manage locks apparently stop inventory screens being activated or displayed including No Lockpick Activate﻿. That is not a conflict, its you installing stuff that breaks base game mechanics.

(3) The base game placed Lodge player safe [ 00266e81 ] has been used for secure central storage by over 15,000 players since launch with previous legacy iterations of Link Lodge Workbenches﻿ and Unlimited Storage, zero operating issues.

(4) Yes you can use Universal Stash in games that already have the previous f Link Lodge Workbenches﻿ and Unlimited  Storage legacy iterations NO PROBLEM. They have all been designed to allow that migration path, BUT DO NOT REMOVE ANY ACTIVE SCRIPTS FROM A SAVEGAME, JUST LEAVE THEM. It would be best to switch any of your BAT files and HOTKEYS to use the Universal Stash global proxy script functions as the older solutions will not be maintained.

(5) Installing mods disables achievements.



===========
Known Issues


(1) Outpost Stash Auto Transfer may not consistently return inventory from an Outpost to the Lodge Stash when the player leaves. The root cause is a game DEFECT. Scripts try to detect this broken ass game state and recover, but if it is too annoying just disable Automatic Outpost Transfer globally in the menu and use the [ Switch with Stash ] activation option on the transfer containers.

(2) Using activator items that open menu screens direct from aid inventory can sometimes (0.01%) freeze the player when in a ship interior cell. Reset/fix that by using the aid inventory activator once more and just exit the menu, or console [ player.moveto player ]. If in 3rd person jump to clear the animation. Activating items from favourite keys has zero issues. 

(3) This is a scripted solution. You can totally disable it doing anything in your game using the menu, but don't try and remove scripted mods from a savegame. Even though some may get lucky, SKK does not support the removal of any CreationEngine mod from an active savegame. Those who know, know.

Great pick. SKK Universal Stash is the most “set-and-forget” way to make outpost/bench crafting pull from one infinite pool.

What to do (fast path)
Install

PC (Nexus): install SKKUniversalStash.esm + BA2 via a mod manager (or copy to ...\Starfield\Data and enable in plugins.txt). Current release is v009 (2024-06-23). 
Nexus Mods
+1

PC/Xbox (Creations): install from the in-game Creations menu (listed as “SKK Universal Stash”). 
creations.bethesda.net
+1

First run

Go to The Lodge → use the AID item to Enable Universal Stash (bedroom or basement). This links the Lodge safe as your global stash and auto-connects workbenches for crafting. 
Nexus Mods

Wire up outposts

Build one “Universal Stash Outpost Transfer” container per outpost (Misc menu). With Auto Outpost transfer ON, it pulls from the Lodge stash while you’re on site and returns items when you leave. If you see odd behavior, switch Auto OFF and use the container’s Switch with Stash action manually. 
Nexus Mods

(Optional) Place the Outpost Production Collector (capacity 999,999) and link extractors/cargo links to it; use its Consolidate all production + to Stash actions to push resources into the stash. (Auto-pushing to unlimited containers is intentionally not automated to avoid engine edge-cases.) 
Nexus Mods

Safety & known quirks
Do not connect the blue Outpost ship transfer container to a Stash Transfer Container; it can cause item loss. 
Nexus Mods

Before removing a transfer container or scrapping an outpost, Switch with Stash (or Reset Outpost Transfer Container from the menu) so nothing spills to the player. 
Nexus Mods

Very rarely an AID-item open can freeze in ship interiors; just trigger it again and exit, or player.moveto player if needed. 
Nexus Mods

SKK confirms compatibility through Shattered Space / 1.14.70. 
Nexus Mods

Mods disable achievements (unless you use an achievements-enabler). (General modding behavior; SKK notes this as well.) 
Nexus Mods

Nice pairings (throughput & less clutter)
High-Capacity Cargo Links — doubles freighter throughput so production chains don’t jam. Load late. 
Nexus Mods

TN’s Outpost Storage (multiplier) — 3×–50× capacity for vanilla storage (solid/gas/liquid/warehouse, cargo links, transfer container). Even with an infinite stash, bigger buffers near extractors reduce trip counts. Available on Nexus and Creations. 
Nexus Mods

If you want, I can give you a one-page checklist (install → enable → outpost wiring → failure recovery) tailored to PC or Xbox so you can reference it while building.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 10s
You’re launching/attaching SFSE against the wrong install path.

The log shows:

procPath = C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield\Starfield.exe
…but your actual game is at:

D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield

That means you either (a) have SFSE files (and possibly a stray Starfield.exe) under C:\…\common\Starfield, or (b) your shortcut/mod manager is pointing there. Fix it like this:

Do this (precise, safe steps)
Verify the real game folder

In Steam: Starfield → ⚙️ → Manage → Browse local files → confirm it opens D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield.

Put SFSE in the same folder as the real Starfield.exe

Ensure these are in D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\:

sfse_loader.exe

sfse_steam_loader.dll

sfse_*.dll (the versioned SFSE runtime DLL)

Data\SFSE\sfse.ini

Data\SFSE\Plugins\ (your SFSE plugins, if any)

Remove/neutralize the stray C: copy

Check C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield\.

If it exists and is not your live install, rename it (e.g., Starfield_old) or delete it once you’re sure it’s just leftovers.

(Optional, advanced) Create a junction so nothing ever points wrong again:

rmdir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield" /S /Q
mklink /J "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield" "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield"
Run in an elevated CMD. Only do this if you truly had a duplicate.

Launch correctly

Direct: run D:\…\Starfield\sfse_loader.exe (make a desktop shortcut whose Target is that file and Start in is the D:\ Starfield folder).

Vortex/MO2: set the game/executable path to D:\…\Starfield\sfse_loader.exe.

Via Steam Play button: ensure sfse_steam_loader.dll is in the D:\ root; launching from Steam will load SFSE.

Confirm

Start the game, then check sfse.log again. procPath and config path should now show D:\…\Starfield.

Extra checks (common gotchas)
Version match: SFSE build must match your Starfield runtime (check EXE Version or main-menu version; update SFSE if needed).

Permissions: avoid running from Program Files (x86); you’re good on D:. If you must keep the C:\ folder for other reasons, use the junction above.

Mod manager paths: in Vortex/MO2, verify both the game and tool paths point to D:\… (no dangling C:\ references).

Do the five steps above and that log will follow the D:\ path, and SKK Universal Stash (and other SFSE plugins) will load reliably.

using vortex
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 46s
Got it—here’s how to make Vortex point to your D:\…\Starfield and always launch via SFSE (so the log stops showing C:\...).

1) Make Vortex manage the correct game folder (D:)
Vortex → Settings → Games

If Starfield shows Managed at C:\…, click Unmanage.

Click Scan (or Find), then Manage the game at
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\Starfield.exe.

Confirm the Starfield tile now displays the *D:* path.

2) Put mods & deployment on the same drive (fewer Windows/permission issues)
Settings → Mods

Mod Staging Folder → Move to something like D:\Vortex Mods\Starfield.

Deployment Method → Hardlink (recommended on NTFS).

Click Deploy Mods.

3) Install SFSE in the D:\ Starfield root
Place these in D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\:

sfse_loader.exe

sfse_steam_loader.dll

sfse_*.dll (the SFSE runtime)

Data\SFSE\sfse.ini (plus Data\SFSE\Plugins\ for any SFSE plugins)

(If you previously dropped SFSE into C:\..., remove/rename that stray folder to avoid confusion.)

4) Tell Vortex to launch SFSE (not the vanilla EXE)
Vortex → Dashboard

You should see Starfield Script Extender auto-detected. If not: Add Tool → Target:
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\sfse_loader.exe
Start In: the same Starfield folder.

On the tool’s 3-dot menu → Make Primary.

Now clicking Play in Vortex runs sfse_loader.exe from **D:**.

5) Re-deploy & verify
Vortex: Purge Mods → Deploy Mods (forces all links to D:).

Launch once from Vortex. Then open:
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\Data\SFSE\sfse.log
Confirm procPath and config path both show D:\….

6) SKK Universal Stash (your chosen mod)
Install via Vortex (Nexus). Ensure SKKUniversalStash.esm is enabled under Plugins.

In-game: use the AID item to Enable Universal Stash in the Lodge (then add one Outpost Transfer container per outpost if you like).

Optional safety net (only if some tool still insists on C:)
If you must keep a C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield path alive, make it a junction to D:\ (elevated CMD):

rmdir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield" /S /Q
mklink /J "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield" "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield"
Quick troubleshooting
SFSE not loading when using Steam Play button: ensure sfse_steam_loader.dll is in the *D:* game root; or just always launch via Vortex (primary tool = SFSE).

Mods not appearing in game: re-check Staging Folder on D:, Deploy Mods, and that the game in Settings → Games shows **D:**.

Still see C:\ in logs: you missed Step 1 or the SFSE tool in Dashboard still points to C:\—edit it to D:\ and retry.

Do those steps and SFSE + your mods (including SKK’s stash) will load cleanly from D: every time.

Short answer: yes—but there are two flavors.

Safest: kah — Kill All Hostiles near you (won’t nuke neutrals/friendlies).

Nuclear: killall — kills everyone nearby (non-essentials), so don’t use in towns.

Single target: click an enemy in the console, then type kill.

Note: story-critical (“essential”) NPCs usually just get incapacitated, not permanently killed. Using the console disables achievements unless you use an enabler.

Yep—you can add/spawn those Project Warfare guns via console. Because they’re from a mod, you first need the actual FormID that’s active in your load order, then use player.additem.

Quick method (works for any modded weapon)
Find the weapon’s FormID

help "Ripper Classic" 4 weap
help "Tac-16" 4 weap
help "Peacekeeper" 4 weap
help "Peacekeeper MK2" 4 weap
help "Fang-45" 4 weap

(Optional) Force a higher quality tier
Adding via console gives the base tier; you can apply a quality OMOD:

Drop the weapon on the ground → open console → click it (you’ll see a ref ID like FF0ABCDE).

Apply a tier OMOD to that ref:

FF0ABCDE.amod 0028F442   ; Calibrated
FF0ABCDE.amod 0028F443   ; Refined
FF0ABCDE.amod 0028F444   ; Advanced
FF0ABCDE.amod 0028F445   ; Superior (top)
(These tier OMOD IDs are known base-game IDs.)

Attach mod parts (if you want specific builds)
You can also attach mod parts:

help "Ripper Classic" 4 omod     ; list its attachments
FF0ABCDE.amod <OMOD_ID>          ; attach to the selected weapon
(Repeat per attachment.)

No-console alternative (if you prefer immersion)
Both Hardened Edition and Addon Pack 1 distribute the guns via vendors & dispensers (e.g., Neon Core/Trade Authority, Akila Rowland Arms, HopeTown), and Addon Pack 1 also injects them into leveled lists; you can just buy/find them.

that would be cool 
Short answer: yes—but there are two flavors.

A) “Author your own” (Creation Kit)

Companion Dialogue Framework (Nexus + Creations): a CK framework that lets mod authors make true custom companions (reaction interjections like Constellation, compatibility layer, example plugin). If you want to build one, start here.

how do I do that?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 2m 26s
Awesome—here’s the minimum, reproducible path to make your own companion in Starfield using the Creation Kit and the Companion Dialogue Framework (CDF) so they can react to quests like Constellation members.

0) Prereqs (once)
Install Starfield: Creation Kit from Steam (free). It’s Bethesda’s official editor for Starfield. 
Steam Community

Install CDF (either source is fine):

Nexus: “Companion Dialogue Framework” (includes an example plugin + author docs). 
Nexus Mods
+2
Nexus Mods
+2

Creations: same framework published for in-game manager. 
creations.bethesda.net
+1

(If you’ll ship voiced lines) install Wwise and learn the WAV→WEM + lipsync pipeline. The community tutorials below are the current go-tos. 
YouTube
+1

1) Create your plugin + load CDF (5 minutes)
Open CK → File → Data… → check Starfield.esm → Set as Active File (or create a new empty plugin and then Convert to ESM later if you plan to ship a Creation). Basic “hello world” guide for first plugins here. 
Reddit

Still in Data…, mark CDF’s ESM as a master (so you can use its dialogue subtypes & templates). The Nexus page calls out that it’s a Plugin – Full Master, intended to be used as a dependency or merged for paid Creations. 
Nexus Mods

Tip: CK has been updated through 1.14.78 with better localization support; if you plan multilingual lines, take advantage of it. 
AFK Mods

2) Build the companion Actor (10–20 minutes)
Actors → Actor: duplicate a similar NPC (human or robot) or create new.

Fill the Actor record minimally: name, race, stats/leveling, Voice Type (create a new one if you have custom voice), Relationship (set to Ally for testing), outfit, and AI packages (sandbox when not following).

Export FaceGen so your NPC isn’t gray/bald: select your actor in the correct race branch and press Ctrl+F4 (CK generates FaceGen to Data\meshes/textures). 
ck.uesp.net
+1

If you’re brand new to Starfield followers, this short, practical CK tutorial shows a human/robot/creature follower setup end-to-end. 
YouTube
+1

3) Make a simple recruit/dismiss quest (MVP follower)
Quests → New: MyCompanion_Quest. Set Start Game Enabled (for testing) and Run Once unchecked.

Aliases: add a Reference Alias for your companion (fill with Specific Reference → your Actor) and a Player alias.

Dialogue: add a Topic on the companion alias for recruitment (e.g., “Follow me”) and another for dismissal. Condition the lines with GetIsID == MyCompanion and your own quest stage flags.

Stages: Stage 10 = offered; 20 = recruited; 30 = dismissed; gate dialogue by stage.

Follower behavior: use packages or the follower setup shown in the CK tutorial series (it covers follow, costs, and robot quirks). 
YouTube
+1

This gives you a working “hire/dismiss” companion you can walk around with—now you can layer CDF reactions.

4) Plug into Companion Dialogue Framework (quest reactions)
CDF’s core idea: your companion contributes “reaction” lines via Dialogue Subtypes so multiple modded companions can react to the same events without conflicts. The author provides an example plugin + an article (“How to Utilize This Framework…”) showing the steps; follow that while you do the below. 
Nexus Mods
+1

Typical wiring pattern (high level):

With CDF as a master, duplicate CDF’s example quest/records into your plugin (or make your own but keep the same Dialogue Subtypes they use). The framework specifically lists Main Quest and certain side quests already covered (e.g., Groundpounder, Operation Starseed, Juno’s Gambit, Mantis, Overdesigned, First Contact). 
Nexus Mods

Register your actor with CDF (the article tells you whether that is via a formlist, keyword, or alias fill; follow it exactly—this avoids patch wars). 
Nexus Mods

Add your companion’s reaction lines under the provided Dialogue Subtypes and condition them on the right vanilla quest stages (CDF documents which stages it listens to). 
creations.bethesda.net

Test: run the MQ beats (e.g., Lodge power moment) and verify your lines fire alongside Constellation companions without conflicts—the “no-conflict subtype” mechanism is the whole point of CDF. 
creations.bethesda.net

5) (Optional) Crew capabilities & skills
If you want your companion to act as ship/outpost crew, populate their crew skills and ensure they can be assigned via the Crew menu. Public guides explain how crew assignment and effects work; implement the skills that suit their role and test assignment in the in-game Ship → Crew screen. 
GamesRadar+

6) Voice & lipsync (if voiced)
Foldering (Starfield CK):
Data\Sound\Voice\<YourPluginName>.esm\<VoiceType>\00012345.wav/.wem
(The ID matches the topic line’s form ID.) 
Nexus Mods

Make WEM (what the game plays) with Wwise; many modders follow Joseph Russell’s video. 
YouTube
+1

Generate lipsync with CK’s FaceFX compiler; the community guide walks the exact steps + pitfalls (voice type/body type must match, no spaces in paths). 
Nexus Mods

7) Test fast (console)
Start your recruitment quest: startquest MyCompanion_Quest or setstage MyCompanion_Quest 20 to force “hired”.

Move the NPC to you: click them in CK and place in a safe cell, or player.placeatme <ActorBaseID> (testing only).

Validate CDF reactions by jumping to a covered quest beat and confirming your subtype lines fire. (CDF’s page lists supported quests and the 1.1 changelog.) 
Nexus Mods

8) Package & (optionally) publish
ESM + BA2 (assets) for tidy distribution.

If you’re publishing on Creations, CDF’s author explicitly allows merging the framework into paid companions with credit, or shipping it as a dependency. Read their permission note on the page. 
Nexus Mods

5) (Optional) Crew capabilities & skills

yes I want that !!!
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 40s
Got you. Here’s the clean, reproducible way to make your custom companion assignable as ship/outpost crew and give them crew skills that actually affect ships/outposts.

A) Make your NPC “crew-ready”
Goal: your companion shows up in the Crew roster and can be assigned to a ship or outpost.

Call the crew API when hired
In your recruit TopicInfo, add a Papyrus fragment that puts them in the roster:

; Alias_Companion is a ReferenceAlias pointing at your NPC
Game.AddToAvailableCrew(Alias_Companion.GetActorReference())
(You can test the same function from console:
cgf "Game.AddToAvailableCrew" "<refID>".) 
Reddit

Test it quickly
In game → Menu → Ship → Crew (or Outpost → Crew Station) and confirm your NPC appears and can be assigned. (General crew assignment behavior is covered in Bethesda’s Creations notes and guides.) 
creations.bethesda.net
+1

B) Give them crew skills (the bonuses)
Crew bonuses are implemented via Perks (skills) on the Actor record. You add them just like any NPC perks.

Where in CK: open your NPC → Actor → Perks (a.k.a. SpellList) → Add the skill perks at the rank you want. A practical tutorial that shows adding/modifying perks on followers: Creation Kit Tutorial 17 – Create Simple Followers (see “Modifying and Adding Perks”). 
YouTube

Common ship crew skills (effects in brackets):

Astrodynamics (reduces grav-jump fuel / calc time). 
RPG Site
+1

Piloting (↑ top speed; high ranks add +1 engine power on named companions). 
RPG Site

Leadership (increases assignable crew cap when this crew is assigned). 
RPG Site

Aneutronic Fusion (extra reactor power). 
RPG Site

Shield Systems (↑ shield capacity / power effects). 
Reddit

Starship Engineering (faster system repairs). 
Reddit

Ballistic / Energy / EM / Missile / Particle Beam Weapon Systems (boosts that weapon type). 
starfield.fandom.com

Outpost-oriented skills:

Outpost Engineering, Outpost Management, Geology (useful at outposts; also drive follower “gift” behavior for mats). 
starfield.fandom.com

Tip: Some vanilla companions appear to have crew skills that aren’t visible in CK due to templating; adding perks directly on your actor works for custom companions. If you ever need to tweak a live save, you can add/remove crew skills in-game via a tool like NPC Enhancer Gun (Creations). 
Nexus Mods Forums
+1

C) Recommended “role packs” (drop-in sets)
Pilot (speed/jumps)

Piloting (Rank 2–4), Astrodynamics (2–4), Leadership (1–2).
Result: snappy grav-calcs, longer hops, and a free crew slot. 
RPG Site

Engineer (power/repairs/shields)

Aneutronic Fusion (1), Starship Engineering (3–4), Shield Systems (2–3). 
RPG Site
+1

Gunner variants

Ballistic / Energy / EM / Missile / Particle Beam Weapon Systems (2–3) depending on your ship fit. 
starfield.fandom.com

Outpost foreman

Outpost Management (2), Outpost Engineering (2–3), Geology (1–2). 
starfield.fandom.com

D) Verifying effects (don’t guess—measure)
Ship: Assign the NPC, then check the Ship builder stats (cargo, shields, reactor power) and in-flight handling (top speed, jump calc, fuel use). Community testing and guides quantify these effects (e.g., −10/−20/−30% fuel for Astrodynamics ranks; +reactor power for Aneutronic Fusion). 
Reddit
+2
RPG Site
+2

Outpost: Ensure there’s a Crew Station built; assign the NPC and observe production/quality-of-life changes. 
polygon.com

E) Console fallback (useful for testing)
Target your NPC in console, then:

; add a crew skill
addperk <PerkID> <rank>

; remove it
removeperk <PerkID>
(You can look up perk IDs on reputable lists if needed.) Remember: console use can disable achievements unless you use an enabler.

If you want, tell me the exact role you want this companion to fill (pilot / engineer / gunner / outpost lead), and I’ll give you a copy-paste CK checklist with the specific perk ranks and the 1-line recruit fragment to add to your existing dialogue so they appear in the crew menu immediately.

Tips/caveats

Some crew skills don’t have 4 ranks—only add ranks that exist to avoid odd behavior. 
Reddit

After changing skills, unassign/reassign them or change area to refresh bonuses.

Console use can disable achievements unless you use an enabler; the NPC Enhancer Gun (Achievement-Friendly) avoids that. 
creations.bethesda.net

If you tell me the role (pilot/engineer/gunner/outpost lead), I’ll give you a ready-to-paste command set (exact perk IDs + ranks) for that build.

How to keep achievements with mods
PC (Steam, Vortex + SFSE)

Install SFSE and Address Library. 
Nexus Mods
+1

Install Baka Achievement Enabler (SFSE). 
Nexus Mods

In Vortex Dashboard, set the tool/executable to sfse_loader.exe (make it Primary) so the game launches through SFSE. 
Nexus Mods

Verify: load your save once, make a fresh save, then pop an easy achievement (e.g., craft something). Users report it removes the (C) “modded” flag when configured correctly. 
Nexus Mods

Creations (PC/Xbox)

By default, Creations disable achievements unless the item is tagged “Achievement Friendly.” Check the creation’s page for that label before installing. Examples: many mods publish an AF variant.

You said:
Do I have to start a new game for the achievement stuff to work?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 31s
Short answer: no—you don’t need a new game.

What you need for achievements to work again on your existing save:

PC (SFSE path)

Install SFSE, Address Library, and Baka Achievement Enabler (SFSE).

Launch the game via sfse_loader.exe (make it Primary in Vortex).

Load your current save → make a new manual save → (if nothing pops later) quit to desktop and reload that new save once.

From now on, achievements will trigger even if you use mods/console.
Note: Steam/Xbox achievements are not retroactive—only new triggers count. If you already did the thing while achievements were off, do the next instance (e.g., craft another mod, build another outpost item, win another space fight, etc.).

Creations on PC/Xbox

Use items specifically labeled Achievement Friendly. No new game needed; they simply don’t set the “modded” flag.

Sanity checks if it still doesn’t pop:

Verify Baka is loaded (Data/SFSE/Plugins contains it; SFSE log lists it).

Make sure you’re not launching the vanilla EXE by mistake (Vortex: Primary tool = sfse_loader.exe).

Ensure Steam/Xbox is online and overlay/achievements aren’t disabled globally.

If you tell me your platform (PC/Xbox) and what you’ve installed so far, I’ll give you a 60-second checklist tailored to your setup.

You said:
Am on pc
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 26s
Perfect—here’s the 60-second PC checklist to keep achievements with mods:

Install the trio (to your D:\ Starfield folder)

SFSE → game root (same folder as Starfield.exe).

Address Library for SFSE Plugins → via Vortex (auto to Data\SFSE\Plugins\).

Baka Achievement Enabler (SFSE) → ends up as Data\SFSE\Plugins\BakaAchievementEnabler.dll.

Vortex launch path

Settings → Games: Starfield managed on D:\… (not C:).

Dashboard: add tool sfse_loader.exe from D:\… and Make Primary.

Deploy Mods (Hardlink recommended).

Verify it’s loaded

Launch via Vortex (so SFSE runs).

Check D:\…\Starfield\Data\SFSE\sfse.log — you should see SFSE running and the Baka plugin listed/initialized.

Save hygiene

Load your current save → make a new manual save → quit to desktop → relaunch → load that new save (helps clear the “modded” flag).

Pop an easy achievement

Do any fresh trigger (examples): craft a weapon/space suit mod, complete a research project, place an outpost item, or discover a new system. Achievements aren’t retroactive; do a new instance.

Common pitfalls (quick checks)

Accidentally launched vanilla EXE → fix by launching sfse_loader.exe from Vortex.

Game updated → update SFSE + Address Library.

Baka missing → confirm the DLL is in Data\SFSE\Plugins\ and shows in sfse.log.

Steam overlay/achievements disabled → enable (Steam → Settings → In-Game).

That’s it—no new game required. If you want, tell me your current SFSE + Baka versions and I’ll sanity-check compatibility against your Starfield runtime.

Here you go—two precise ways:

1) Set your level directly

Note: this changes the level number but doesn’t grant skill points. Use the XP method below if you want normal level-ups with points.

2) “Natural” level-ups via XP (recommended)
player.modav experience <amount>
or

cgf "Game.RewardPlayerXP" <amount>
Examples:

player.modav experience 50000
cgf "Game.RewardPlayerXP" 1000

ChatGPT said:

Yes. You can build an outpost immediately—there’s no prerequisite quest and you don’t need any outpost skill to start.

How to do it (PC)
Land anywhere build-eligible, open the scanner, press R to place an Outpost Beacon. (On controller it’s X.) 
Polygon

If you see “Area is restricted,” you’re too close to a city/POI; move away until the ring is clear—outposts can’t be placed inside POI radii. 
Steam Community

Build basics. The beacon itself costs no materials; the first “habitable” structure (e.g., an Airlock) does—typical starter costs include small amounts of aluminum/lead/sealant. 
Game8

What you do not need
No tutorial/mission; outposts are optional sandbox content. 
Polygon

No skill investment to place a normal outpost. (Skills help later.)

can i console command resources directly into my workbench? and how do I use the SKK Universal Stash in my outpost
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 12s
Short, exact answers:

1) “Console resources straight into a workbench”?
Not directly. Workbenches pull from your inventory (and ship cargo) in range. So you add mats to yourself, then the bench sees them.

How to add mats to yourself

Find the FormID:

help "Aluminum" 4 misc
help "Adhesive" 4 misc
help "Sealant" 4 misc
help "Titanium" 4 misc
Add the amount:

player.additem <FormID> <count>
Example (after you got the ID):

player.additem 0001A2B3 200     ; gives 200 Aluminum
(Advanced) You can add straight into a specific container:

Open console, click the container (its RefID shows at top).

Then:

additem <FormID> <count>
…but since outpost containers are many and dynamic, adding to player and letting benches consume it is usually safer.

Tip: Make a quick batch file so you don’t retype. Create Starfield\Data\mats_al.bat with lines like:

player.additem <AluminumID> 500
player.additem <AdhesiveID> 200
player.additem <SealantID> 200
Then in game: bat mats_al.

2) Using SKK Universal Stash at your outpost (so “everything is available”)
One-time setup
Install SKK Universal Stash and enable it at The Lodge

In AID inventory: Enable Universal Stash (bedroom or basement).

(Fast console way) cgf "SKK_USQuestScript.EnableFromAnywhere"
This links the Lodge safe as your global, unlimited stash and auto-connects workbenches for crafting.

Wire an outpost to the stash
At the outpost, build one “Universal Stash Outpost Transfer” (Build → Misc)

With Automatic Outpost transfer = ON (default), when you are on site the transfer container pulls your Lodge stash content locally so building/crafting can use it.

When you leave, it pushes everything back to the Lodge stash for safekeeping.

(Optional but recommended) Build Outpost Production Collector (capacity 999,999)

Link all extractors/cargo links to it.

Use its “Consolidate all production” then “to Stash” (or to Transfer) action to sweep resources.

By design, the mod does not auto-push produced resources to the infinite stash to avoid engine edge cases—trigger the transfer when you visit.

Controls you’ll actually use
AID item → Open Universal Stash (anywhere).

AID item → Reset Outpost Transfer Container (if a transfer didn’t return to the Lodge).

AID item → Automatic Outpost transfer [On/Off] (toggle if you prefer manual control).

Container activation → “Switch with Stash” (manual one-shot transfer).

Safety notes
Do not wire the blue ship transfer container directly to the SKK transfer—keep them separate.

Before deleting a transfer container or scrapping the outpost, “Switch with Stash” (or use Reset Outpost Transfer Container) so nothing spills to the player.

Using console commands/mods can disable achievements unless you’ve installed an achievement enabler (e.g., Baka Achievement Enabler) and launch via SFSE.

If you tell me which materials you burn through most (e.g., Aluminum, Tungsten, Titanium, Adhesive, Sealant), I’ll spit out a ready-made bat file with the correct help lookups and additem lines so you can top up in one go.

could you give me the commands for a solid amount of material to get me started

Thought for 27s
Yep—here’s a starter pack of the most-used build/craft mats with quick console commands. Because FormIDs can vary, first look up the ID, then add a chunky amount.

Step 1 — Look up each ID (copy the 8-digit hex it prints)
help "Aluminum" 4 misc
help "Iron" 4 misc
help "Copper" 4 misc
help "Nickel" 4 misc
help "Cobalt" 4 misc
help "Tungsten" 4 misc
help "Titanium" 4 misc
help "Lead" 4 misc
help "Silver" 4 misc
help "Gold" 4 misc
help "Adhesive" 4 misc
help "Sealant" 4 misc
help "Fiber" 4 misc
help "Polymer" 4 misc
help "Lubricant" 4 misc
help "Solvent" 4 misc
help "Helium-3" 4 misc
help "Water" 4 misc
help "Benzene" 4 misc
help "Chlorine" 4 misc
help "Argon" 4 misc
Step 2 — Add a solid amount (replace <ID> with what you got)
; Core metals (outposts & crafting)
player.additem <AluminumID> 600
player.additem <IronID> 600
player.additem <CopperID> 400
player.additem <NickelID> 400
player.additem <CobaltID> 300
player.additem <TungstenID> 300
player.additem <TitaniumID> 200
player.additem <LeadID> 300

; Precious (for mods/research)
player.additem <SilverID> 100
player.additem <GoldID> 100

; Organics/industrial (benches & research)
player.additem <AdhesiveID> 200
player.additem <SealantID> 200
player.additem <FiberID> 300
player.additem <PolymerID> 200
player.additem <LubricantID> 150
player.additem <SolventID> 150

; Gases/liquids (outpost power/processing)
player.additem <Helium3ID> 500
player.additem <WaterID> 200
player.additem <BenzeneID> 200
player.additem <ChlorineID> 200
player.additem <ArgonID> 200
Optional: make it one-click later
Do Step 1 once and note the IDs.

Create a text file at Starfield\Data\starter_mats.bat with the player.additem lines above, but with the real IDs filled in.

In game, open console (German keyboard: Ö) and run:

bat starter_mats
Notes
Workbenches pull from you (and ship cargo). If you’re using SKK Universal Stash, place a Stash Outpost Transfer at your outpost so building/benches can use your global stash while you’re on site.

If you accidentally overfill: player.removeitem <ID> <amount>.

Using the console can disable achievements unless you’re running an achievement enabler and launching via SFSE.

so the Universal Stash will then be available any time I wanna craft something anywhere ? or how will that work?

Thought for 12s
Great Qs — here’s the precise behavior + ready-to-paste commands using your IDs.

How SKK Universal Stash works (crafting “anywhere”)
Global stash link (Lodge): after you Enable Universal Stash in the Lodge (AID item), any workbench you activate (ships, outposts, cities) gets auto-connected to the stash for crafting materials. So at that bench you can craft as if all your mats were on you.

Outposts: build one “Universal Stash Outpost Transfer” per outpost (Build → Misc). When you’re on site, it mirrors your Lodge stash locally so building & benches can use it. When you leave, it autosends everything back to the Lodge stash.

Manual pulls anywhere: the AID item Open Universal Stash lets you open the stash UI from anywhere to move items by hand.

Production note: the Outpost Production Collector gathers extractor output, but pushing to the infinite stash is manual (use “Consolidate all production” → “to Stash/Transfer”).

Don’t wire the blue ship transfer container into SKK’s transfer; keep them separate.

One-time “starter kit” — console adds (using your IDs)
Paste these into the console (Ö on DE keyboard). Quantities are “solid but sane” for early building/crafting; tweak as you like.

how do I start a new ship from scratch?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 24s
Yes. You can “start from scratch” in the Ship Builder—you don’t need a special quest or a prefab hull.

Two clean ways to start fresh
A) Strip your current ship to a cockpit stub (fastest)

Talk to any Ship Services Technician → Ship Builder.

Remove everything you can until only a cockpit (or some single piece) remains.

You can’t delete the last required piece; keep a cockpit as your anchor, then build up from there.

Build your new ship around that cockpit.

B) Buy a cheap A-class ship as a blank canvas

Purchase the cheapest A-class from a vendor (low part count = fewer scrap fees), set it as Home Ship, enter Ship Builder, then rebuild.

Minimum parts checklist (what a ship must have to pass Flight Check)
Cockpit (provides control + ladder)

Reactor (Class A/B/C must match your Piloting skill: A=any, B=Piloting Rank 3, C=Rank 4)

Grav Drive

Fuel Tank(s) (for the grav drive)

Engines (enough thrust for your mass)

Landing capability:

Either a Landing Bay (already includes docking port and bay doors), or

A Docker plus enough Landing Gear for total mass

Hab pathing from bay/dock to cockpit (use 1×1 or 2×1 Companionway pieces if needed)

Optional but recommended: Shield Generator, Heatsinks, Cargo, Weapons (not strictly required to fly).

Practical build order (avoids 90% of validation errors)
Cockpit (pick one you like; place near CoM).

Companionway + 1–2 Habs (create a clear path for ladders).

Landing Bay (simplest because it includes a docker) or add Docker + Landing Gear.

Reactor (Class A to start) → Grav Drive → Fuel Tank(s).

Engines: add until the Thrust / Mass indicator goes green (lighter ships need fewer).

Shield (optional), then Cargo/Weapons.

Run Flight Check and resolve any red warnings (missing docker/gear, no path to cockpit, reactor class mismatch, etc.).

Rename, Set as Home Ship, exit, and pay the build fee.

Tips
If you don’t want a landing bay, you must add a Docker to dock in space.

Keep the center of mass roughly within your landing gear footprint (builder shows it).

If Flight Check says “No path to cockpit”, add/snap a Companionway between hab blocks.

If you upgrade to B or C parts, make sure your Piloting rank allows them; otherwise the builder will fail validation.

You can build purely A-class first, then refit later as your Piloting rank increases.

Want a minimal, cheap A-class parts list (specific vendor parts that pass Flight Check instantly), or a combat-ready starter layout? Tell me your preference (cargo vs. speed vs. combat) and I’ll give you an exact bill of materials.

You said:
Are there any mods that increase outpost build limit?
And are there any mods that provide outpost defense items?
And is there a command to trigger a settlement attack?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 44s
Here’s the straight scoop:

1) Mods to raise outpost limits
Increase Outpost Limit to 40 (Creations, PC/Xbox) — raises the global number of outposts you can own from 24 → 40. Safe and simple. 
Bethesda Creations

Outpost Limits Increased (Creations) — raises per-category build caps in the outpost system (so you can place more of certain items). 
Bethesda Creations

Increased Outpost Size (Nexus) — expands the build radius around the beacon (camera can clip at the extreme edge). 
Nexus Mods

Infinite Outpost Build Budget / expandbuildbudget (Nexus) — console/bat approach to make the budget bar effectively unlimited. Works, but it’s save-permanent and heavy builds can hit performance. Backup first. 
Nexus Mods
+1

(FYI: some players report there’s still a deep engine ceiling even if the “budget bar” is removed—so don’t expect literally infinite everything.) 
Facebook

2) Mods that add outpost defense items
Inquisitor Defense Systems (Nexus & Creations) — adds five new turrets (Flamethrower, Cryo, Lightning, Missile, Plasma) to the Defense tab. Easy plug-in if you want real firepower. 
Nexus Mods
+1

OUT – Outpost Ultimate Tweaks (Nexus) — big build set (walls, fences, platforms, prefabs) to actually fortify your sites. 
Nexus Mods

Inquisitor Palisade Walls & Tower (Creations) — 7 wall types + a tower for simple perimeter defenses. 
Bethesda Creations

(Reminder: vanilla turrets exist too; higher marks unlock via the Outpost Defense research lines.) 
Inara

3) Can I trigger an outpost attack with a command?
Vanilla: there isn’t a reliable built-in console command to start a raid on demand. Attacks are more likely if you build the Armillary at an outpost, and they only occur when you’re present. 
Reddit
+1

Best way (mod): SKK Outpost Attack Manager — build an Attack Terminal at your outpost and trigger on-demand raids or timed/random ones; also lets you hire mercs and unlock more turret support. Available on Nexus and Creations. 
Nexus Mods
+1

DIY via console (simulated raid): spawn enemies near your beacon:

; examples (spawn near you)
player.placeatme 0027BB8F 6   ; LvlSpacer_Assault
player.placeatme 00054327 6   ; LvlCrimsonFleet_Assault
player.placeatme 0026FF67 6   ; LvlEcliptic_Assault
(These leveled lists are the same types SKK’s mod uses; clean up corpses/strays afterwards.) 
Nexus Mods

If you tell me PC vs. Xbox (you’re on PC, right?) and whether you want bigger radius, more items, or more total outposts, I’ll give you a minimal, stable pick (e.g., Limit 40 + Inquisitor turrets + SKK Attack Manager) and the exact menu paths to place the parts.

Looking for a heal item or something, an item that heals my character continuously 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 27s
Yep—there are legit “continuous heal” options. Quick menu:

Vanilla “always healing”
Rejuvenation (Physical skill, Master tier): passive HP regen outside combat; at Rank 3–4 it also regens in combat (faster at R4). 
Starfield Wiki
+1

Pack mod: Regeneration (install on your boost pack): passively regens HP outside combat. Research Pack Mods 3, then craft at a Spacesuit Workbench. 
Game8
+1

Aid items (Med/Trauma/Emergency Kits) are strong heal-over-time, but not continuous. (Emergency Kit = a big short HoT.) 
Bethesda Support
+1

Mods (PC) if you want “hands-off” healing
Health (Creations): auto-regenerate HP outside combat up to ~33% of max as a baseline. 
Bethesda Creations

SmartDoc or Smart Heal: auto-uses the best kit when you drop below a threshold—no PerkIDs/console needed. 
Nexus Mods
+1

Fastest path right now (what I’d do)
Put Regeneration on your pack (works everywhere, zero clicks).

Grab Rejuvenation later; rank it up to add in-combat regen.

Crafting “Regeneration” (materials + commands)
You’ll need Amino Acids ×3, Hypercatalyst ×3, Positron Battery ×1, Emergency Kit ×2. If you want to console them in, here are plain commands:

player.additem 000055CD 3
player.additem 0029F40D 3
player.additem 00246B71 1
player.additem 002A9DE8 2
Then craft Regeneration at a Spacesuit Workbench (after Pack Mods 3). 
Game8

(Optional) Console-only passive regen
If you just want a permanent trickle without skills/mods, you can tweak actor values (backup your save first):

player.modav HealRate 0.5
player.setav CombatHealthRegenMult 0.5
That adds gentle out-of-combat regen and allows some in-combat regen. Increase/decrease the numbers to taste; you can later undo with player.forceav HealRate 0 if needed. (Community-documented workaround for Rejuvenation behavior.) 
Nexus Mods

Want me to add Regeneration to your current pack via console (amod) instead of crafting? I can give you the 2-line method to find the OMOD ID and apply it safely.

back to outpost, tried this: getav 399 
forceav 399 0
but did not seem to work 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 26s
You were super close—the issue is targeting. getav/forceav 399 only works if the Outpost Beacon itself is selected in the console. If you ran it with no target (or with player targeted), nothing happens.

Do this (per outpost)
Stand at the outpost, face the beacon.

Open console (German keyboard: Ö).

Click the beacon until the top line shows something like OutpostBeacon <RefID>.

Run (exactly):

getav 399
forceav 399 0
getav 399 = shows the current budget used.

forceav 399 0 = sets budget used to 0 (so the meter never fills).

Notes

You must repeat this for each outpost (it’s stored on the beacon).

If you scrap/rebuild the beacon or migrate the outpost, re-run the two commands.

This doesn’t raise category caps (turrets/robots/etc.). For those, use a mod like Outpost Limits Increased (Creations) or similar.

Optional: “no budget” via INI (global)
If you prefer an always-on setting, add this to Documents\My Games\Starfield\StarfieldCustom.ini:

[Workshop]
bBudgetEnabled=0
(Then restart the game.)

If you still see a budget warning after this, tell me what the console header shows when you click—the most common gotcha is accidentally having the player selected instead of the beacon.

how do I activate noclip, like fly trhoug walls and stuff
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 13s
Use noclip = no collision:

Toggle noclip (player)
tcl
Runs on the currently selected ref; if you might have clicked something in the console, force it on the player:

player.tcl
Move around while noclip
Use WASD, Space (up), Ctrl (down).

Toggle again to restore collision:

tcl
Optional fly-camera (freecam)
Detach the camera (good for screenshots/clipping checks):

tfc
Pause world while freecam:

tfc 1
Change freecam speed:

sucsm 5
(try 1–10)

Safety tips
Quicksave first. Don’t turn noclip off while inside geometry—back out into open space, then tcl again.

If you get lost: tcl off, or fast-travel, or player.movetoqt (to the current quest target).

are there any ship parts with stairs, or only the one cockpit?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 39s
Short answer: in vanilla, stairs are basically only in the Nova Galactic “Cabot” bridge cockpits; everything else uses ladders. If you want more stair pieces, use a mod.

Vanilla
Nova Galactic Cabot Bridge (C3/C4) — a two-level cockpit with an internal staircase. Buy it from the Ship Services Tech at New Homestead (Titan) when it appears in stock (C4 usually needs Starship Design 2 / higher level). 
inara.cz

Other habs/companionways = ladders only; there aren’t elevators. Community notes consistently call Cabot the only functional staircase part in base game. 
Reddit
+1

Ladder placement tip
Ladders prefer 1×1 Companionways. Stack the 1×1s where you want the vertical connection, then build rooms off them so the game doesn’t auto-drop ladders through bedrooms. 
Reddit

Mods (if you want real stairs/ramps)
Ship Extension (Creations): adds multiple stair modules (e.g., “Stairs Long – Stroud – 3×1×2”) and other multi-story corridor pieces so you can design ships with stairs instead of ladders. 
creations.bethesda.net

If you tell me your ship’s manufacturer theme (Nova, Stroud, Taiyo, etc.), I’ll point you to the exact vendor for the Cabot bridge and suggest a clean ladder layout.

any mods on nexus
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 20s
Yep—on Nexus there are stair mods:

Ship Extension — adds multiple internal stair modules for ships (e.g., “Stairs Long – Stroud – 3×1×2” and aft variants). Lets you build real multi-story corridors without relying on the Cabot cockpit. 
Nexus Mods

External Ship Stairs & Platforms — places external stairs/walkways on your ship so you can climb around the exterior in high-G worlds (useful for surveying/hunting). 
Nexus Mods

If you want internal stairs only, grab Ship Extension. If you want rooftop access and catwalks outside, add the External Ship Stairs mod too.

could you give me a overall comparison of 
Deimos, Hope Tech, nova, Stroud Eklund and Taiyo habs
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a practical, builder-focused comparison of the five major hab lines. I’m focusing on what actually affects building/flow (doors, ladders, station mix, windowed variants, special modules) rather than lore.

High-level takeaways
Functionally, habs differ mainly in door/ladder placement, built-in workstations, window availability, and mass. Stats like armor don’t change with brand; layout does.

For clean pathing, prefer habs with centered doors and pair them with 1×1 Companionways to control ladder spawns.

Brand by brand
Deimos
Look: Military/industrial (dark steel, green accents).

Layouts: Mostly center-door 2×1 and 3×1; predictable ladder spawns; good for grid layouts.

Windows: Few; more “bunker” than “view.”

Notables: Solid Armory and Battle Station variants; good for combat ships.

Quirks: Minimal glass; interiors feel tight.

Best for: Combat/thematic military builds; simple pathing.

HopeTech
Look: Heavy-industry (orange/olive), utilitarian.

Layouts: Practical dooring; many 2×1 utility habs.

Windows: Sparse; functional over scenic.

Notables: Workshop/Industrial habs with handy bench placements; pairs well with large cargo stacks and landing bays.

Quirks: Can feel cramped; lighting is harsh.

Best for: Haulers/freighters and “workhorse” builds.

Nova Galactic
Look: Classic NASA-punk; neutral palettes.

Layouts: Good mix of center-door pieces.

Windows: Decent, but not as panoramic as Stroud/Taiyo.

Notables: Cabot bridge cockpits (staircase inside)—the only vanilla cockpit with stairs; excellent for two-deck designs.

Quirks: Some 3×1 pieces have offset doors—mind ladder placement.

Best for: Mixed-role ships and anyone wanting stairs without mods.

Stroud-Eklund
Look: Corporate luxury (clean white/blue), bright lighting.

Layouts: Consistently clean door alignment; easy to route.

Windows: Best panoramic options among vanilla habs (nice 2×1 windowed rooms).

Notables: Good Infirmary, Lounge, Battle Station variants with tasteful layouts; shipyard offers plentiful parts.

Quirks: Slightly heavier on some modules; glossy aesthetic not for everyone.

Best for: Flagships and “showpiece” builds with views.

Taiyo
Look: Sleek, high-tech (Neon vibe, dark with neon accents/wood touches).

Layouts: A mix; some offset doors—plan for companionways to tame ladders.

Windows: Strong—stylish windowed lounges; less bright than Stroud but very premium.

Notables: Captains Quarters/Lounge variants feel most “luxury apartment.”

Quirks: Occasional odd ladder spawns if you chain offset doors.

Best for: Stylish personal ships; luxury explorers.

Functional modules cheat-sheet
Crafting/benches inside the ship: look for Workshop / Infirmary / Science variants in Deimos/Hope/Stroud/Taiyo lines. Stroud/Taiyo place benches in roomier spaces; Hope packs them tight.

Crew flow: brands with centered doors (Deimos/Stroud) reduce “No path to cockpit” errors; add 1×1 Companionways as vertical trunks to decide where ladders go.

Views: Stroud (most), Taiyo (stylish), Nova (moderate), Hope/Deimos (minimal).

Mass (rule of thumb): Stroud/Taiyo windowed pieces tend to be a touch heavier than bare-bones Deimos/Hope utility habs—rarely build-breaking, but it affects TWR on tiny A-class frames.

Vendor anchors (for planning)
Deimos: Deimos Staryard (Deimos/Mars); Akila City techs carry some.

HopeTech: Hopetown (Polvo).

Nova Galactic: New Homestead (Titan).

Stroud-Eklund: Stroud-Eklund Staryard (Narion).

Taiyo: Neon (Volii Alpha).

Recommended mixes (practical)
Luxury explorer: Stroud windowed 2×1 for views + Taiyo Lounge/Captain’s Quarters; Nova Cabot cockpit if you want stairs.

Combat carrier: Deimos core grid (center doors) + Deimos Armory/Battle Station; minimal windows; HopeTech workshops.

Freighter/industry: HopeTech Workshops + Deimos utility habs; keep corridors straight for fast traversal.

Ladder & dooring tips (to avoid headaches)
Pick a vertical trunk: stack 1×1 Companionways where you want ladders.

Snap habs off that trunk; prefer center-door rooms on main traffic lines.

Validate with Flight Check and walk the interior before paying; move any offset-door pieces that force ladders into bedrooms.

If you tell me your target role (combat hauler, luxury explorer, carrier), I’ll propose a 6–8 piece hab layout (by brand) that passes Flight Check and minimizes ladder chaos.

what was no clip again
ChatGPT said:
Noclip = no collision.

tcl

how do I assing weapons to ships again?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s
Here’s the quick way to (re)assign ship weapons:

Assign weapons to groups
Talk to any Ship Services Technician → Ship Builder.

Press Flight Check (PC default: C).

Go to the Weapons tab.

Drag/click each weapon into Group 1, 2, or 3 (you can stack multiple of the same model in one group up to the 12-power cap; you can’t put one weapon in multiple groups). 
DualShockers

VideoGamer

Fire them in space
The three groups map to your three ship-weapon fire buttons (check Settings → Controls → Ship on PC to see which keys/mouse buttons they’re bound to). 
Steam Community

Tips
If you see “Unassigned Weapon”, you added a weapon but didn’t put it in a group—fix it in Flight Check → Weapons. 
VideoGamer

You can have only three groups, but each group can include several copies of the same weapon until the group’s power bar (max 12) fills. Mixed models in the same group aren’t allowed.

Want me to sanity-check your current build for optimal grouping (e.g., lasers in 1, ballistics in 2, missiles in 3) based on your parts?

where can I buy the best ships?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 20s
Here’s where to buy the top-tier, ready-made ships—and why each stop is worth your credits.

S-tier vendor stops
Taiyo Astroneering (Neon, Volii Alpha) – Sells the Narwhal, widely considered the best all-round purchasable ship (huge power/cargo, strong shields). Go into Ryujin Industries → elevator → Taiyo Astroneering showroom; talk to Veronica Young. Expect ~450k credits before Commerce discounts. 
PC Gamer

Prima Games

HopeTech Showroom (Hopetown, Polvo | Valo system) – Sells Silent Runner (massive freighter with great range/cargo) plus other heavy haulers. Enter the HopeTech building; talk to Inaya Rehman. 
The Gamer

Game8
+2

Stroud-Eklund Staryard (Narion system, Deepala orbit) – Premium corporate ships (e.g., Conqueror). Also great for outfitting with Stroud parts if you plan to rebuild. 
PC Gamer
+1

Paradiso Ship Services (Porrima II) – Often stocks the Abyss Trekker (high-end combat ship). Vendor stock rotates; check back if it’s not there. 
The Gamer
+1

Deimos Staryard (Deimos, Sol) – Military-leaning catalog; good starting points for combat-focused builds before custom upgrades. 
The Gamer

Tips to actually buy them
Inventory rotates by vendor and day; if a named ship isn’t listed, rest 24–48h and recheck. (Paradiso’s Abyss Trekker especially.) 
inara.cz

Commerce skill lowers the eye-watering sticker prices (Narwhal/Silent Runner), and Starship Design lets you immediately refit with higher-tier parts. 
Dot Esports

Vendor brands matter for parts: Taiyo/Stroud/Deimos/HopeTech shipyards sell their unique modules you won’t see at generic city techs. 
Hard Drive

If you tell me what you value most (cargo vs. combat vs. range), I’ll recommend the one ship to buy first and the 3–4 parts I’d swap on day one.

the universal stash thing, does that work with storage boxes in outpost as well
ChatGPT said:
Short answer: partly.

What is linked globally: the Lodge safe (your Universal Stash). When you’re on-site at an outpost that has one SKK “Outpost Transfer” container placed, that container mirrors the Lodge stash for building & workbenches. When you leave, it auto-returns items to the Lodge.

What is not globally linked: your regular outpost storage boxes (solid/gas/liquid/warehouse, decorative chests, etc.). They do not auto-sync with the Universal Stash.

How it works together when you build/craft:
Outpost building and workbenches will pull mats from (a) the SKK Outpost Transfer container (which is acting as your global stash on site) and (b) any normal outpost containers present. So you can keep local buffers if you want—but those locals won’t follow you to other places unless you transfer.

Moving items between locals and the stash:

Use the Outpost Transfer container’s activation option “Switch with Stash” to push/pull everything at once, or

Use the AID menu “Open Universal Stash” anywhere to move items manually.

For extractor outputs, link them to the Outpost Production Collector → activate “Consolidate all production” → then “to Stash” (manual by design).

Do not connect the blue ship transfer container to the SKK transfer.

If you want, tell me your outpost layout and I’ll suggest a clean routing: extractors → Production Collector → (manual) Stash Transfer, plus which locals are safe to keep as buffers.

This mod brings you new armor sets!

I am finally done! This took me a bit to make!
It's a standalone it adds to your game! Enjoy!

As stated this mod adds 4 new armors, The Bounty Hunter, The Starshogun, The Gunslinger and The Operator. 
Each armor should come with about 6 skins or more. I made them as customizable as possible for as many personal combos as I could handle implementing.

This mod replace Does Not anything. Generally when you see "Standalone in the title that would mean that the mod referenced is new and an addition to the game and does not replace anything within the game."

"All armors are craft able and can be found at the industrial workbench, I plan on adding them in loot tables later as well as making them a little more expensive to make." The armors themselves "at the moment" can only be found at the industrial workbench

"Now with full modable armor sets!" 
Each whole armor set now comes with mod slots to modify the suit along with custom enchantments to buff the suit as you like
New legendary mods are as followed:

Stealth Boy
Stim Boost
Strong Back
Knock Back 
Radiating Heat
Reflect Damage

This includes 4 mod slots for each full armor set "the full body armor sets, the ones that come with an upper body and lower body and sleeve/gloves"

the 4 mods slot include the new enchantments + plus the normal armor mods. The normal armor mods are also included with the enchantments, they are separate from one another, each mod chose will take up one slot.

Stealth boy will be located in slot 1
Stim boost will be located in slot 2
Strong back or knock back will be in slot 3
Radiating heat and Reflect Damage will be in slot 4

The helmet/visors are not modifiable, the random attachments to the armor sets are also not modifiable. "This may change in the future." 

"Some of the screenshots may list different variations of the suit, that's is because some of the screenshots taken include armor sets made during mod development and those stats may have been adjusted." One should trust the mod description over the screenshots presented to list what the mod contains."

"Yes the normal suit modifications are also included."

God stats have been removed 
"If you have armors currently with god stats you will need to recraft them as the stats will hilariously stay." They will retain the prior stats and will need to be sold and re-crafted.

Some the attachments have been added as apparel, I'll add the rest later

Display katanas
Display Holster
Rattan Hat
Flak Vest
Jacket 

"Both the flak vest and jacket fit most of the normal outfits, however some may clip."


along with these new armor sets, I've included a few new attachments and armor addons:

Adds a ton of visor textures.
Rattan Hat
Shogun Helmet
Plated Hoods
Operators Hat
Operators Skull
Wings   (Meant for display / cool look)
Modular Shoulder plates 
Modular leg plates
Many many different variations of cape               (Standard, Full, poncho, strip, back, front / back, Kama, cape)
Modular Jackets                                                      (These cover most armor well - there is two versions that are sized to fix specific armors)
Modular armors                                                       (Separated for mix and match freedom)
Display weapons that attach to any spacesuit
Modular Starborn Helmets / visors                          (Separated for mix and match freedom)

The haz-op helmet only has one texture, "honestly I forgot it was there." I'll fix that in the future."

I've also made the vanilla Starborn armors craftable and linked them with my custom skins along with the vanilla skins. 
"No, this does not mean they replace, change or add anything to the existing vanilla starborn armors." "these are new craftable armors unrelated to the vanilla sets but have the same exact stats, value, etc that allow for my skins to fit with vanilla armors without changing the base game armors." 

"No, this mod should not conflict with the TN armor mods, because these are all added items. nothing in this mod changes anything to base game items."

This mod also adds a new melee weapon "Yes, you can equip the off-hand katana and duel wield" 

"The armor that say "Modular armor" that is missing it's arms is meant to be missing the arms. Its modular, that means it goes with the jacket that has arms. I did this so you can mix and match skins from the jack and the armor. "

All of the armors "the main armors" come with a boostpack even though they aren't listed as having one, therefore you can add a second boostpack to each armor.
The game seems to have a problem with stacking boost pack stats not sure why. 

Some things will clip, this is unavoidable depending on what you want to mix and match.

"As of now, the game seems to have a problem with loading a super abundant number of skins, this appears to be an engine problem. Some skins may fail to load in the menu screen or in game to fix this all you need to do is equip and unequip or just walk through a door or save and reload your game and the textures should reappear just fine. "


This mod uses an esm. It will require SFSE

Installation:


Use vortex: 

If a mod has an ESM file you will need to enable the ESM "USE THE PLUGIN ENABLER LINK and FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THEIR MOD PAGE TO LEARN HOW TO ENABLE AN ESM" otherwise the drag and drop method will not work.
If Vortex doesn't work, drag and drop the mesh folder into your Documents/Mygames/Starfield/ or steamapps/common/starfield/data. And then be sure to activate/enable the esm

If you are still having issues I recommend following it up with a plugin enabler

(plugin enabler)
https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4157 

If you use the mod from the link above be sure to follow the directions included on that mods page.

Don't forget to keep everything updated and enable your custom.ini





If the model doesn't show up in-game, more than likely:
You've updated your game or custom folder and it's changed it's ability to load mods
Baka whatever updated or any of the other major game-changing experimental mods that rewrite major system functions have updated.
The installation location or method of installation is incorrect. 
The mod is missing packed files. "If you open the folder and see that all of the files are there then you can rule this out."
As these mods are replacer mods and replace the hard files of existing assets, that means the game physically cannot avoid loading these models and textures. These are overrides. Provided they are in the proper location, your inicustom enabler is working properly to enable mods, and the game is loading from the proper location there should not be an issue. If there is check your game's installation / what you've installed and what is listed above. the only other way you wouldn't see a model or texture is if it was not included in the package entirely.






Enjoy!


Don't forget to endorse if you like this mod... that lets an author know to do more of that thing and feel validated over their hard work <3 Comments and support go a really long way towards showing a modder modding is worth it.

how do I get/craft these? for this mod
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 19s
Here’s the quick, reliable way to get and upgrade everything from TG’s Stylized Starborn Armor Pack (Standalone) on PC.

1) Where to craft the new armors
Go to any Industrial Workbench (e.g., Lodge basement, The Den, any outpost with one built).

You’ll see new craft categories added by the mod (near the bottom). Craft the full sets:

Bounty Hunter

Starshogun

Gunslinger

Operator

The author also made vanilla Starborn-style suits craftable here (they don’t replace vanilla—these are added copies so skins work).

2) How to mod them (slots & “enchantments”)
Take the crafted suit to a Spacesuit Workbench.

Each full-body set has 4 mod slots:

Slot 1: Stealth Boy

Slot 2: Stim Boost

Slot 3: Strong Back or Knock Back

Slot 4: Radiating Heat or Reflect Damage

You can also add the usual vanilla spacesuit mods (environmental, ballistic/energy resist, etc.).

Helmets/visors and some add-on bits aren’t modifiable (per the author).

3) Extra pieces & skins
Many attachments (jackets, capes, holsters, wings, shoulder/leg plates, hats/helmets) are included. Several are flagged as Apparel so you can wear them over outfits.

Tons of skins are included; if a skin’s preview fails to load, just equip/unequip or pass through a door / quicksave+reload (engine quirk the author mentions).

4) If you don’t see the recipes
Run through these quickly:

Ensure the ESM is enabled in Vortex → Plugins (the mod ships as an ESM).

If needed, install a plugin enabler and follow its page steps (the author links one).

Confirm SFSE is installed and you’re launching via sfse_loader.exe (Vortex Primary Tool).

Make sure StarfieldCustom.ini is active (typical lines):

[Archive]
bInvalidateOlderFiles=1
sResourceDataDirsFinal=
If it recently updated, re-deploy mods in Vortex.

5) Console alternative (if you want to spawn instead of craft)
Use this pattern to pull the exact items by name (caps don’t matter):

help "Bounty Hunter" 4 armo
help "Starshogun" 4 armo
help "Gunslinger" 4 armo
help "Operator" 4 armo
player.additem <FormID> 1
Repeat for accessories (e.g., help "Rattan Hat" 4 armo).
If you want to upgrade a suit instantly via console mods, you can drop it on the ground, click it in the console (get the refID), and use .amod <OMODID>—but using the Spacesuit Workbench is safer.

If you tell me which one set you want first (e.g., Starshogun) I’ll give you: 1) the exact menu path at the Industrial Workbench, and 2) a suggested four-slot mod combo for stealth/combat or tanky play.

You said:
hmm, models dont load 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 23s
Gotcha—when models don’t load for TG’s Stylized Starborn Pack it’s almost always one of these: the ESM isn’t enabled, the BA2s aren’t in the live Data folder, or loose/BA2 loading isn’t set up right after a game update. Do this quick, in order:

1) Fast diagnosis (2 checks)
A. Do the items exist?
In-game console:

help "Starshogun" 4 armo
If you get results → the ESM is loading.

If you get nothing → the ESM isn’t active (jump to step 2).

B. If the ESM loads but the suit is invisible:
player.additem <FormID> 1 → equip → invisible or red “!” = meshes/textures BA2 not loading (step 3).

2) Make sure the plugin is actually enabled
In Vortex → Plugins: the mod’s .esm must be ENABLED.

Starfield (post–2024) requires a plugins.txt enabler. Install/enable one (the author links it) and deploy.

You’re on D:\…\Starfield. In Vortex Settings → Games, confirm Starfield is managed on D:\…, not on C:. Then Deploy Mods.

3) Make sure the assets are in the live Data folder
In your game folder, you should have (names may vary slightly):

D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\Data\
  TG_StylizedStarborn.esm        (example)
  TG_StylizedStarborn - Main.ba2 (meshes/textures)
  (…any other TG_*.ba2 from the mod)
If you installed manually to Documents\My Games\Starfield\Data: move everything to the game’s Data above. (Starfield no longer reliably loads assets from Documents.)

4) Enable asset loading (only needed for loose files)
If the mod ships loose meshes/textures (some variants do), ensure:

Documents\My Games\Starfield\StarfieldCustom.ini

[Archive]
bInvalidateOlderFiles=1
sResourceDataDirsFinal=
Then restart the game.

5) Redeploy and hard-refresh the cell
In Vortex: Purge → Deploy.

In-game: equip/unequip once, walk through a door (load screen), or quicksave→reload. (The author notes the engine sometimes drops skin/material binds until a cell reload.)

6) Quick sanity checks (common gotchas)
SFSE/loader path: Launch via sfse_loader.exe (your Vortex Primary).

Duplicate installs: Make sure there isn’t a stray C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\…\Starfield copy confusing paths.

Load order: This mod adds items (standalone), so load order rarely matters—but the ESM must be active and its BA2s present.

7) Confirm it’s fixed
help "Operator" 4 armo → player.additem <ID> 1 → equip.
If you now see the model, the BA2s/loose files are loading correctly.

Crafting: go to an Industrial Workbench → scroll to the new armor categories near the bottom.

If it’s still invisible after all that
Tell me:

The exact filenames you see in …\Starfield\Data\ for this mod (.esm and .ba2).

Whether help "Starshogun" 4 armo returns results.

Your Vortex Staging Folder path and Deployment Method (Hardlink recommended).

I’ll pinpoint the mislink (it’s usually a path mismatch or a missing BA2).

Got it—you’ve confirmed the items exist (ESM is loading), but equipping shows nothing. That almost always means the meshes/textures aren’t being read or you’re equipping modular overlays without the base suit. Do this, in order:

1) Make sure the assets are in the live Data folder
Open D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\Data\

You should see the mod’s .esm and one or more .ba2 archives (names like TG_*.esm, TG_* - Main.ba2, TG_* - Textures.ba2).

If they’re under Documents\My Games\Starfield\Data\ or only in Vortex’s staging, move/redeploy so they exist in the game’s Data above.

In Vortex: Purge → Deploy (Hardlink). Then relaunch via sfse_loader.exe.

2) Force the game to refresh assets
Equip/unequip once → walk through a load door (or quicksave → reload).
The author notes the engine sometimes drops skin/material binds until a cell reload.

3) Equip a base suit, not just overlays
From your screenshot, many hits are “Modular … Plates/Shoulder/Leg”. Those are attachments/apparel overlays. First make sure you’re equipping a full armor entry such as:

Starshogun Armor

Starshogun Warrior Armor
Then add modular plates/jackets on top. If you equip only plates (and your underlying suit uses the same body slot), they can appear “invisible”.

4) Quick isolation test (rules out conflicts)
Unequip everything (spacesuit/helmet/pack/apparel).

Add and equip just one full set:

player.additem 18000801 1    ; Example: Starshogun Armor (use your ARMO ID)
equipitem 18000801
If that shows up, start layering the modular pieces.

5) If still invisible after #1–4
Recheck BA2s: if the ESM is present but no BA2 archives are in …\Data\, models will be invisible/red “!”.

If the mod uses any loose files, ensure:

Documents\My Games\Starfield\StarfieldCustom.ini
[Archive]
bInvalidateOlderFiles=1
sResourceDataDirsFinal=
Then restart.

Load order: let the TG ESM load after any global armor replacers/frameworks you use. Then redeploy.

6) Sanity checks
Launch via SFSE (the mod requires SFSE).

Make sure you don’t have a duplicate C:\…\Starfield path with an old copy of the mod—Vortex might be deploying there. Your active game is on D:.

If you want, paste me one full-armor FormID from your help output (e.g., the Starshogun Armor ID you see), and I’ll give you exact console lines to equip it + a minimal mod combo (jacket/plates) that should render—useful to confirm the pipeline is working.

I Installed with vortex 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 9s
Gotcha—since you used Vortex, let’s hit the 3 things that most often make armor look “invisible” even though the items exist:

1) You might just be hiding it (very common)
Starfield hides spacesuits in safe settlements by default.

Fix: Settings → Gameplay → Show Spacesuit in Settlements → ON.
Or in the Inventory, make sure the helmet/pack “Hide” toggle isn’t active.

2) Make sure you equipped a full suit, not just overlays
From your help screenshot most entries are Modular … Plates/Shoulders/Legs (overlays). First equip a full body suit (e.g., Starshogun Armor or Starshogun Warrior Armor), then add plates/jackets. If you only equip plates, they share the same body slot as outfits and can appear as “nothing.”

3) Verify Vortex actually deployed the assets (ESM is loading, but BA2s might not)
Do these exact Vortex checks:

Starfield managed at D:\…
Settings → Games → Starfield should show D:\SteamLibrary\…\Starfield. If it shows C:\…, Unmanage → Manage at **D:**.

Staging & deployment
Settings → Mods → Mod Staging Folder is on *D:* (click Move if not).
Deployment Method = Hardlink. Click Deploy Mods.

Plugins enabled
Plugins tab → make sure the mod’s .esm is ENABLED (green). Vortex should also have the plugins.txt enabler active.

Files are in the live game Data
Dashboard → Starfield tile → Open Game Folder → open Data\. You should see the mod’s .esm and one or more .ba2 archives (meshes/textures).
If you don’t see BA2s here, redeploy (or reinstall the mod) so they land in this Data\ folder.

Quick in-game test (after the checks)
Unequip all outfit/spacesuit items.

Console: player.additem <ID_of_Starshogun_Armor> 1 → equipitem <sameID>

Walk through a door (or quicksave → reload) to force a cell reload.

If it shows now, add the modular plates/jackets you like.

If it still doesn’t show: tell me what you see in …\Starfield\Data\ for this mod (the exact .esm and .ba2 filenames), and whether you were standing in a settlement with the spacesuit-hide option on. I’ll zero in on the remaining culprit fast.

different question, how do I remove thes mods??
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 24s
Got you. Those entries mean two different things:

What you’re seeing
Lock icon + “Not managed by Vortex” (e.g., SFBGS003.esm, BlueprintShips-Starfield.esm)
→ These are Creations / official BGS plugins installed by the in-game Creations system (or bundled with updates). Vortex can’t remove/disable them.

lewdoutfits.esp with “Not managed by Vortex”
→ That ESP was installed manually (copied into Data or dropped by another tool), so Vortex doesn’t control it.

Remove Creations / official plugins
Launch Starfield → Creations (main menu).

Manage / Library → Installed.

Select the item (e.g., Blueprint Ships, any SFBGS00x that shows up there) → Uninstall.

Quit the game fully and relaunch.

Note: Some SFBGS00x.esm files are now part of official updates/DLC and can’t be removed without breaking the game. Only items that appear under Creations → Installed can be uninstalled.

Remove a manually installed plugin (e.g., lewdoutfits.esp)
Go to your actual game Data folder (yours is on D:):
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\Data\

Delete:

lewdoutfits.esp

Any matching archives like lewdoutfits - Main.ba2, lewdoutfits - Textures.ba2 (names vary—remove anything clearly belonging to that mod).

Remove its entry from plugins.txt (if present):

Typical path with a plugins enabler: Documents\My Games\Starfield\plugins.txt

Delete the line *lewdoutfits.esp (or unstar it). Save.

In Vortex: Purge → Deploy (to refresh links).

Launch the game.

Save safety: before removing any mod, make a new manual save, unequip items from that mod, and clear them from containers. After removal, load the new save. Scripted mods shouldn’t be removed mid-save; armor/texture mods are usually fine but the items will disappear.

If a mod is Vortex-managed
Use Mods tab → Disable or Remove. Vortex will clean the files for you; then Deploy Mods.

If you tell me which exact Creation(s) you want gone, I’ll confirm whether they’re uninstallable and the exact names you’ll see in the Creations menu.

back to ships
S-tier vendor stops
where? prio 1 look cool 

same for spacesuits

give me exact locations
weapons as well 

also remember the mods i have for weapons and so on
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 33s
Got it—here’s a tight, “looks-cool-first” shopping list with exact places to go on PC. I’ll also note where your Project Warfare guns show up.

Ships (style priority)
1) Taiyo Astroneering showroom — Neon (Volii Alpha)

Enter Ryujin Tower lobby → elevator to Taiyo Astroneering.

Talk to Veronica Young at the desk.

Catalog: sleek Taiyo hulls; often stocks the Narwhal (fan-favorite flagship).

2) Stroud-Eklund Staryard — orbit Deepala (Narion)

Grav to Narion → target Stroud-Eklund Staryard (around Deepala) → dock.

Reception desk vendor right inside.

Catalog: glossy, panoramic-window habs and stylish hulls; great for showpiece builds.

3) Nova Galactic (New Homestead) — Titan (Sol)

Land at New Homestead → Ship Services tech outside.

Catalog: classic NASA-punk looks; Cabot bridge cockpits (the stair one).

4) Deimos Staryard — orbit Deimos (Sol)

Target Deimos Staryard near Mars → dock.

Catalog: military/industrial aesthetic; good for tough-looking builds.

5) HopeTech Showroom — Hopetown (Polvo, Valo)

Land Hopetown → enter the big HopeTech building.

Talk to Inaya Rehman.

Catalog: chunky industrial freighters (e.g., Silent Runner) with a “working ship” vibe.

Spacesuits (cool factor vendors)
Neon (Volii Alpha)

Neon Tactical (Core tower floor) – flashy suits/helmets with a Neon vibe.

Sieghart’s Outfitters (Core) – fashion/apparel; sometimes suit variants.

New Atlantis, Jemison

Centaurion Arsenal (Commercial District) – premium suits/helmets alongside weapons.

Jemison Mercantile (by spaceport) – rotating stock; often stylish sets.

UC Distribution (Commercial/MAST area) – UC-branded pilot/guard looks.

Akila City, Cheyenne

Rowland Arms / Laredo Firearms – primarily guns, but also carry rugged Western-leaning suits.

The Shepherd’s – general store; rotates in some nice suits.

Cydonia, Mars

Trade Authority & local vendors – occasional striking miner/industrial suits.

Tip: vendor stock rotates—sleep 24–48h in the city if you don’t see something you like.

Weapons (and where your Project Warfare mods integrate)
With Project Warfare – Hardened Edition + Addon Pack 1, their guns are injected into leveled lists and show up at:

Centaurion Arsenal (New Atlantis)

Neon Tactical (Neon Core)

Rowland Arms / Laredo Firearms (Akila City)

Trade Authority kiosks (most major hubs)

Random drops on appropriate enemy tiers (your notes: e.g., Peacekeeper ~18, Tac-16 ~20, Ripper “Classic” ~24)

If a specific model won’t appear, use the console help "<name>" 4 weap → player.additem <ID> 1 (you’ve done this already).

Quick pick lists (if you just want my “buy this first” recs)
Ships (style-first):

Narwhal @ Taiyo (Neon) → immediate flagship looks + stats.

Any Stroud panoramic-window build @ Stroud Staryard → best view interiors.

Want stairs inside? Nova Cabot cockpit @ New Homestead.

Spacesuits (style-first):

Neon Tactical for flashy/Neon chic.

Centaurion Arsenal for premium “mil-spec sleek.”

For modded glam, your TG Stylized Starborn sets craft at Industrial Workbench (then mod at Spacesuit Workbench).

Weapons (with your mods):

Make a loop: Centaurion Arsenal → Neon Tactical → Rowland/Laredo → Trade Authority kiosk and check after each 24h rest.

If you tell me the one vibe you want (sleek corporate, neon cyber, military, industrial), I’ll give you a single stop for ship + suit + a likely PW gun that matches the look.

You said:
where is Neon Tactical?? cant find it 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 14s
Neon Tactical is in Neon Core (ground-level market strip).

Fastest path
Land at Neon → take the elevator to Neon Core.

Walk straight into the main promenade ~20–30 meters.

Look to your right-hand side—Neon Tactical is a storefront with gun racks/signage, across from Sieghart’s Outfitters and a short walk from the Ryujin Tower entrance.

If you overshoot and hit the big Ryujin doors, turn around: Neon Tactical is just back along that same strip, opposite Sieghart’s.

Tip: open your local map (M → Neon Core) and hover shops; it’s labeled Neon Tactical.

how do I lvl up companions again?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s
You’ve got two good ways to “level up” companions in practice:

A) Console (directly buff their level/skills/stats)
Target the companion

Open console (Ö on DE keyboard), click the companion so you see their name/ref at the top.
(Or use prid <refID> if you know it.)

Raise their level (scales their health/damage)

setav level 50
resethealth
(Pick any level you want; resethealth reapplies the new max.)

Give/boost combat perks (repeat lines 3× to simulate Rank 4)

addperk 002CE2E0
addperk 002CE2E0
addperk 002CE2E0

addperk 002CE2E0
Oops—let’s keep it clean and useful. Here are ready bundles—run each line 3 times to push to high rank (single-rank perks only once). Use only the bundles you want:

On-foot combat bundle (generalist)

B) No-console, in-game UI
Use NPC Enhancer Gun (Achievement-Friendly) from Creations (or the Nexus version) to change appearance and crew skills via menus—no IDs needed.

Undo / sanity
To remove something: removeperk <ID> (target the companion).

If you raised level too high: setav level 30 → resethealth.

Achievements: if you care, launch via SFSE + Baka Achievement Enabler.

If you tell me one companion’s name + what role you want (pilot/engineer/gunner/outpost foreman), I’ll output a clean, copy-paste block tailored to them only.

If you want different looks, tell me the vibe (tactical, sleek, flashy) and I’ll swap in another suit + rifle combo.

You said:
why placeatme why not additem?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15s
Great question.

additem vs placeatme (what’s the difference?)
player.additem <FormID> <count> — puts the base item straight into your inventory. Cleanest for weapons/armor/aid/mats.

player.placeatme <FormID> <count> — spawns a new object in the world at your feet (then you pick it up). Useful for things that aren’t normal inventory items, or when a guide’s “unique” spawn also gives a free ammo case. It also works if a vendor/NPC should appear.

In short: for guns, armor, suits, and ammo, use additem. I only used placeatme on the suits because many lists show it, but it’s not required.

Clean additem versions (Sniper setup for Simeon)
Give to yourself (then trade), or target Simeon in console and run the same additem on him
MagSniper + ammo

player.additem 0002EB45 1
player.additem 002B5599 800
Tombstone (DMR) + ammo

player.additem 0002EB36 1
player.additem 0004AD3E 1200
Orion (beam rifle) + ammo

player.additem 002773C8 1
player.additem 002B558B 600
Tip: If you target Simeon first (click him so his name shows at the top), you can make him equip instantly:

additem 0002EB45 1
equipitem 0002EB45
additem 002B5599 300
Companions have infinite ammo only for their default weapon type. If you give him a new type (e.g., MagSniper), also give matching ammo.

Suits with additem (pick one look)
Mantis set

player.additem 00226299 1
player.additem 0016640A 1
player.additem 0016640B 1

Constellation set

player.additem 001E2B18 1
player.additem 001E2B17 1
player.additem 001E2B19 1
If you want a legendary from that list that promises a “free ammo case,” that’s why those guides use placeatme. With additem, just add the ammo separately (as shown).

Want me to pick one rifle + ammo amount + one suit that best fits Simeon’s sniper role and your style (tactical vs flashy) and give you a single copy-paste block?

You said:
can companions use aid stuff??

and do they need ammo??
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15s
Short, exact:

Do companions use Aid items?
No. Followers do not auto-use Med Packs, food, or chems.

They self-regen out of combat and when you level up.

If they go downed, you can revive them by interacting and spending 1 Med Pack from your inventory.

(Mods can change this—e.g., auto-heal mods—but vanilla AI doesn’t consume Aid.)

Do companions need ammo?
Default weapon: no ammo needed (infinite for their built-in gun).

Any weapon you give them: yes, they need the matching ammo in their inventory and they consume it.

Ammo has 0 weight, so give big stacks (e.g., 500–1500 for ballistic rifles; 200–600 for particle fuses; 100–300 for shotgun shells).

If they run out, they’ll swap to melee or their default gun.

Quick how-to (clean behavior)
Trade the new weapon to them.

Trade the matching ammo.

(Optional but reliable) Target them in console → force-equip:

equipitem <WeaponID>
Remove other guns so they don’t swap back.

If you tell me the exact rifle you want Simeon to run (e.g., MagSniper, Orion, Tombstone), I’ll drop a one-block command set that gives him the gun, a big ammo stack, and force-equips it.

You said:
lets give him big stacks then 

and let's find him the absolute best Rifle 
ChatGPT said:

Thought
Nice—let’s kit Simeon properly.

Best “sniper” pick (power + range)
Eternity’s Gate (particle beam sniper). Click Simeon so his name shows at the top, then paste:

additem 00329ABB 1
additem 002B558B 3000
equipitem 00329ABB
Great ballistic alternatives
MagSniper

additem 0002EB45 1
additem 002B5599 3000
equipitem 0002EB45
Hard Target

additem 000546CC 1
additem 0004AD3E 3000
equipitem 000546CC
Notes:

You must target Simeon before running these so the items go to him (and equip).

Companions need ammo for non-default guns; the big stacks above keep him firing.

If he swaps back to another weapon, remove other guns from his inventory.

If any project still shows locked in the terminal, change areas (or save/reload) to refresh the research UI.

You said:
Will this unlock crafting of let's say barrels, silencers and so on?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 17s
Yes.

Those CompleteResearch … commands mark the research projects complete, so with Weapon Engineering ranked up (you set it to 4 earlier) you can craft:

Barrels → from the Barrel Mods research line

Suppressors/silencers → in the Muzzle slot, from the Muzzle Mods research line

Magazines/Batteries, Grips/Stocks, Optics/Lasers, Internal Mods → from their respective research lines

Requirements to actually see the options
Weapon Engineering rank high enough for the tier (R1→R4 corresponds to higher-tier mods).

Compatible weapon/slot: only guns that have a Muzzle slot and support a suppressor will show it; some weapon families don’t support suppressors.

Materials on hand (or in range of your stash/bench link).

Use a Weapons Workbench (then pick the gun and browse each slot).

If something still doesn’t appear
Close/reopen the workbench or change area (refresh UI).

Make sure you’re looking at a weapon family that supports that mod.

Some modded guns (Project Warfare) add their own attachments; most respect vanilla research/skill gates, but a few may require only Weapon Engineering. In either case, completing research unlocks the vanilla-gated categories.

Want me to drop a one-click bat file of common crafting mats so you can mod everything immediately?

how do i increase fov?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12s
Three easy ways—pick one:

1) In-game sliders (recommended)
Settings → Display (or Accessibility, depending on build) → adjust:

First-Person FOV

Third-Person FOV

2) Console (session-only)
Open console (Ö on DE keyboard), then:

fov 90        ; sets both views to 90
or

fov 90 75     ; 90 first-person, 75 third-person
(Using the console can disable achievements unless you’re running an enabler via SFSE.)

3) Make it persistent via INI
Create/edit:

Documents\My Games\Starfield\StarfieldCustom.ini
Add:

[Camera]
fFPWorldFOV=90.0
fTPWorldFOV=75.0
Restart the game.

Tip: very high FOVs can distort weapon models/iron sights; 85–95 (FP) and ~70–80 (TP) is a good starting band.

You said:
third person increas only?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 9s
Yep—just bump third-person FOV only:

Easiest: in-game slider (no console)
Settings → Display → Third-Person FOV → set (e.g., 80).
(First-person stays as-is.)

Console (session-only)
Use the two-number form: fov <your current FP FOV> <new TP FOV>
Example (if your FP FOV is 90 and you want TP = 80):

fov 90 80
This changes only third-person. (Using console can disable achievements unless you use an enabler.)

Permanent via INI (TP only)
Edit Documents\My Games\Starfield\StarfieldCustom.ini and add only:

[Camera]
fTPWorldFOV=80.0
Leave fFPWorldFOV out so first-person doesn’t change. Restart the game.

If I want to trial my ship with some proper space combat, where do I go?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Here are the three easiest ways to get reliable, back-to-back space fights and stress-test a new build:

1) Pure practice (no risk, fast resets)
UC Vanguard Pilot Simulator — New Atlantis → MAST (Sublevel).

Sit in the sim chair to run escalating combat waves.

Perfect for checking weapon groups, power routing, shields/engines—no repair bills, no bounties.

2) Guaranteed real fights on demand
Mission Boards (spawn targets in space for you):

Find boards at every major port (e.g., New Atlantis spaceport, Cydonia, Neon, Akila, The Den in Wolf).

Pick contracts like “Eliminate Spacer Ships”, “Destroy Crimson Fleet ships”, “Bounty: Spacer/Crimson Captain”.

They generate an instance with multiple enemy ships; chain a few for continuous combat.

Trackers Alliance kiosks (if you’ve joined) also hand out space bounties.

3) Hot zones (free-roam hunting)
Fly to systems pirates frequent and cruise near planets/moons for encounter rolls:

Kryx / Suvorov (Crimson Fleet area)

Volii (Neon’s system) and Narion corridors (Spacer/Ecliptic traffic)

Sirius / Maheo mid-tier belts
Throttle around points of interest and scan ships; reds = engage. (Expect occasional boardings and reinforcements.)

Tips for testing
Set Repair Kits on a quickslot; carry a few Ship Parts.

In builder, keep groups simple: 1-Lasers (shields), 2-Ballistics/Particle (hull), 3-Missiles/EM.

If you’ve got Project Warfare installed, some enemies will spawn with those weapons—nice for varied TTK checks.

If you tell me your ship’s class (A/B/C) and weapon mix, I’ll point you to a mission type that spawns the right difficulty (e.g., multi-frigate waves vs. fighter swarms).

are there any mods (nexus) that give some proper good turrets for ships??

Thought for 16s
Yep—there are some genuinely good ship-turret mods on Nexus. The best mix right now:

Add brand-new turret types
EM Turrets — full line of EM (ion/disable) weapons as turrets; unlock alongside their manual-fire counterparts. Great for boarding builds. 
Nexus Mods

Missile Turret 19-A-61 (Inquisitor) — adds auto-missile turrets (A-class, slower ROF, big hits). 
Nexus Mods

Plasma Turret (Inquisitor) — custom plasma turret (own projectile/ammo), shows up at ship vendors ~level 30+. 
Nexus Mods

Starkiller Machine Gun & Turret (Inquisitor) — adds a Starborn-style MG + turret with very high fire rate for point-defense vibes. 
Nexus Mods

Phaser Beams & Cannon — 3 new energy weapons including a 360° turret option (Star-Trek flavor). 
Nexus Mods

Improve vanilla turrets (if you prefer stock parts)
Better Full Auto Turret — buffs fire rate/mags/reload on existing turrets (balance tweak, not new parts). 
Nexus Mods

Notes / tips
These install like normal Nexus plugins; ensure your plugins.txt enabler is active (you’ve been using it).

Weapon count quirks: Starfield’s weapon-group limit can make >16 weapons weird. Community testing suggests place your turrets first, finalize, then add extras so they still auto-fire. (Applies broadly, not just EM Turrets.) 
Schaken-Mods

If you also want outpost auto-turrets (not ship-mounted), Inquisitor has a pack with lightning/missile/plasma/cryo/flame outpost turrets. 
Nexus Mods

Want me to suggest an exact loadout (e.g., 2× plasma turrets + 2× EM turrets, missiles on Group 3) tuned to your current B/C-class ship and power budget?
